EFFECTIVENESS OF VICHOS NON-LETHAL COLLARS IN DETERRING COYOTE
ATTACKS ON SHEEP

ABSTRACT: Vichos non-lethal collars containing 45 to 105 ml of 3 % capsicum oleo resin were evaluated as deterrents
to coyote attacks on sheep. Each of five coyotes tested made neck/throat attacks on one collared lamb; four punctured
collars and one pulled the collar from a lamb without puncturing it. One coyote did not resume biting the lamb for
60 min; it was retested two and four days later. At two days, the coyote punctured a second collar and briefly halted
its attack. At four days, the coyote attacked a third collared lamb but made no attempt to grasp the neck/throat area.
In tests resulting in collar punctures (n=5), coyotes immediately stopped their attacks and showed obvious signs of oral
irritation; however, attack behavior resumed shortly thereafter (mean =17.6 min). Coyotes resuming attacks directed
them toward the sides and rears of lambs. The Vichos collar is unlikely to prove effective in controlling coyote
predation on sheep.

INTRODUCTION
When attacking livestock, coyotes (Canis latrans)

typically bite the throat. For this reason, various collars
have been designed (McBride 1974, 1982) and tested
(Connolly 1980; Burns et al. 1988; Burns et al. 1996) as
coyote control tools. One, the Livestock Protection
Collar (LPC), is registered with the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (Moore 1985) and used in several
states (Connolly 1993). While the LPC is designed to kill
coyotes by delivering a lethal oral dose of sodium
monofluoroacetate (Compound 1080, Connolly and Burns
1990), it could also be used to deliver aversive or
repellent substances (McBride 1974).

During development of the LPC, tests with repellents
failed to identify promising aversive agents (Burns et al.
1984). This failure was consistent with the more general
observation that aversive sensory stimuli do not curtail
predation (Linhart 1984; Lehner 1987). Nevertheless,
several studies have reported contrary results; there are
data to suggest that some bitter chemicals (e.g.,
denatonium benzoate), irritants (e.g., capsaicin,
cinnamaldehyde, creosol), and odorants (e.g., mercaptan)
can deter predators (Botkin 1977; Faller 1975; Jankovsky
et al. 1974; Lehner 1987; Lehner et al. 1976; Olsen and
Lehner 1978; Shelton and Thompson unpublished, as cited
in Lehner 1987; Swanson et al. 1975, 1976; Teranishi et
al. 1981).

The Vichos anti-predator collar was developed in
1993. When punctured, the collar dispenses a formulation
of 3% capsaicin oleo resin. Capsaicin is an effective
irritant for most mammals, including all canids tested to
date. Here, the results of an evaluation to determine '
whether Vichos collars deter attacks by captive coyotes on
sheep are described.

METHODS
Tests were conducted between January 9-14, 1995 at

the Predator Research Site of the Denver Wildlife
Research Center (DWRC), 12 km south of Logan, Utah.

During each test, one collared lamb was introduced into
a 9,750 m2 pen containing an adult coyote that had
recently killed sheep and/or goats. Tests continued until
five coyotes each made a neck/throat attack on a collared
lamb and either killed the lamb without puncturing the
collar or punctured a collar and showed some obvious
reaction to the capsicum oleo resin that it contained.
Coyotes that refrained from renewed attacks for 60 min
after the initial collar puncture were tested twice more at
two-day intervals. Coyote-lamb interactions were
observed from a building overlooking the pens and salient
information was recorded on prepared forms.

All animals were identified by uniquely numbered ear
tags and kept in individually numbered kennels and pens.
Animal care and handling were conducted under
procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the DWRC. Lambs severely wounded
but not killed during coyote attacks were euthanized
immediately, irrespective of test time constraints.

Before testing, sheep were collared, and coyotes and
sheep were weighed on an electronic platform scale
(Table 1). Vichos collars of various lengths were
provided by Livestock Protection Products, Inc., Detroit,
Michigan. Each collar contained a quantity of 3%
capsicum oleo resin (Table 1). Collars were filled
through valve stems, and a small bell was attached to the
stems. The manufacturer wanted to explore whether the
bell might act as a supplemental deterrent.

RESULTS
All five coyotes attacked the neck/throat area of

collared lambs. Four collars containing 45 to 105 ml of
3% capsicum oleo resin were penetrated during the
attacks (Table 2). Coyotes that bit through collars reacted
immediately by head shaking, mouth gaping, muzzle
pawing and licking, muzzle rubbing in snow and grass,
and snow eating. One coyote pulled the collar from a test
lamb without puncturing the collar and then made a throat
kill.

aCoyotes stopped attacks on collared sheep at time of collar punctures.
bCoyote was tested two more times after initial collar puncture deterred renewed biting attack for
60 minutes.

Coyotes that reacted to collar contents immediately
stopped their attacks on lambs for a mean of 21.0 min
(n=4, range =1-60 min) and then resumed their attacks
(Table 2), usually at the sides and rear of the lamb. The
single coyote that did not resume attack for 60 min was
subsequently retested twice, at two day intervals. During
the second test, the test lamb was immediately attacked at
various locations and the collar was punctured. Attack
was interrupted for 4 min. Including this result with the
times of the other coyotes provided a mean latency of
17.6 min (n=5, range = 1-60 min) for all tests with collar

punctures and deterred attacks. Two days later, after
collar punctures, the coyote attacked a third collared lamb
at the sides and rear, but made no attempt to grasp
the neck/throat area. In this instance, and at three other
times during the study, intervention in tests was necessary
to euthanize lambs wounded by coyotes attacking from the
sides and rear (presumably to avoid the capsicum-
containing collar). It was evident that coyotes would
have killed these sheep, but not with efficient throat-hold
patterns.

DISCUSSION AND MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS
Vichos collars briefly interrupted attacks on lambs,

but coyote predation was not substantially deterred. This
result is consistent with the general finding that sensory
repellents do not stop predation by coyotes (Lehner 1987;
Linhart 1984). It is worth noting that collars appeared to
redirect attacks by coyotes away from the throat, resulting
in less efficient killing than would have otherwise
occurred.

It was concluded that the Vichos collar is not an
effective tool for the control of coyote predation on sheep.
More importantly, the Vichos collar appears to elicit
predation that is more prolonged, and quite likely, more
painful to prey than predation that would have occurred in
the absence of the collar.
