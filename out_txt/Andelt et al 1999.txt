Abstract Additional methods are needed to deter predators from killing livestock. We tested the 

effectiveness of an electronic dog-training collar to deter captive coyotes (Canis latrans) 
from killing domestic 
lambs by shocking coyotes whenever 
they attempted to attack 
lambs during a 22-week period. The collar averted all 13 attempted attacks on lambs 
by 5 coyotes, 
greatly reduced 
the probability of subsequent attempted attacks, and 
caused coyotes 
to avoid and retreat from lambs for over 4 months (F=16.28; 1,4 df; 
P=0.016). We believe 
this approach to aversive conditioning has potential to reduce 
coyote predation on domestic sheep in limited areas and may apply to a variety of other 
problems involving carnivore predation on domestic or endangered species.

Predators kill significant numbers of sheep, goats, 
and calves in the United States despite various types 
and intensities of predator management used by 
producers and professional wildlife managers to 
reduce depredations (National Agricultural Statistics 
Service 1991, 1995; Andelt 1996). With changing 
public sentiment about the way wildlife damage is 
managed and the loss of some lethal control tech- 
niques, additional methods are needed to manage 
predation on livestock by carnivores. 
Gustavson et al. (1974) proposed and tested con- 
ditioned taste aversion using lithium-chloride-treat- 
ed baits and carcasses to prevent coyotes 
(Canis 
latrans) from killing lambs. The effectiveness of this 
tactic has been intensively researched (Gustavson et 
al. 1974, Burns and Connolly 1980, Burns 1983a, 
Conover and Kessler 1994), and results have been 
controversial (Burns and Connolly 1985; Forthman 
Quick et al. 1985a, b; Lehner and Horn 1985). Our 

assessment of the research indicates that coyotes 
acquired bait aversions but generally did not devel- 
op an aversion to live prey after feeding on sickness- 
producing baits and carcasses. Various applications 
of aversive chemicals 
to the necks or bodies of 
sheep have been unsuccessful in establishing aver- 
sions to live prey in coyotes (Burns 1983b, Burns 
and Mason 1996). 
Linhart et al. (1976) used a prototype electronic 
collar to condition 3 of 4 coyotes 
to avoid black 
domestic rabbits while continuing to prey on white 
rabbits, and thus provided one of the few successful 
applications of aversive conditioning 
in coyotes. 
Electric shock has been used to establish aversions 
to visual and gustatory stimuli in albino rats (Krane 
and Wagner 1975). Electronic collars and electronic 
ear tags also have been used to train cattle to avoid 
certain portions of pastures, such as riparian areas 
(Quigley et al. 1990,Tiedemann et al. 1998). Our objec-

lambs. On 5 May, we moved the 9 coyotes to indi- 
vidual 4.5-m2 kennels under an elevated observation 
tower from which we conducted observations of

a 679-m2,

interactions 

shaped enclosure. We released each of the 9 coyotes 
into the enclosure with 1 lamb during a 2-hour pre- 
trial period on 6 or 7 May 1997, to select at least 5 
coyotes 
that readily performed 
lethal attacks on 
lambs. Four males, but no females, attacked, killed, 
and partially consumed lambs during the initial peri- 
od, and the fifth male (5162) exhibited this behavior 
when 
it was solely retested on 13 May; we used 
these 5 males in our electronic collar trials. We pro- 
vided coyotes water ad 
libitum and fed them 1 
unskinned front or hind quarter of a lamb/day for 4 
days after killing the lamb in the pretrial to enhance 
experience with sheep as a food source. Thereafter, 
we fed coyotes approximately 600 g of commercial 
mink food daily; during electronic collar testing, we 
fed coyotes after the trials. 
We restrained coyotes by hand while we attached 
collars. On 6 and 7 May, we placed non-electronic 
"dummy" collars (Tri-Tronics, Tucson, Ariz., USA), 
which were the same size, shape, and weight as the 
test collar on the 4 coyotes that killed lambs (and on 
13 May we placed a "dummy" collar on the coyote 
that killed a lamb on 13 May), to acclimate them to 
the training collar. On the first day of electronic col- 
lar testing, we permanently removed the "dummy" 
collars and clipped 
the neck hair of coyotes 
to 
ensure that electrical contact with 
the electronic 
collar would be maintained throughout the study. 
Coyotes 5348 and 5366 were aggressive and difficult 
to handle, thus we gave them 0.5-1.5 ml of keta- 
mine hydrochloride 
to 
facilitate 
attaching 
and 
removing the collar 1-24 hours before trials and 
immediately after trials beginning on 15 and 20 May, 
respectively. Both coyotes appeared fully recovered 
from the effects of ketamine hydrochloride before 
we tested them with lambs. We used 1 Model 100 
Lite electronic dog-training collar (Tri-Tronics, Tuc- 
son, Ariz., USA), adjusted to deliver the maximum 
intensity shock; used the highest power setting on 
the 
radiotransmitter, which 
resulted 
in 
325 
pulses/second 
of 600-640 
volts and about 0.032 
ampere of 
instantaneous current (D. V'Marie, Tri- 
Tronics, Tucson, Ariz., USA, personal communica- 
tion); and removed the collar after each trial. 
We placed 1 lamb in the test area and a decoy 
lamb in a 1.0 x 0.75-m cage approximately 1 m out- 
side the enclosure to attract the test lamb to an eas- 
ily observed area. We tested each coyote during 2-

if an electronic 
dog-training 
collar could condition 
captive coyotes 
to stop killing 
domestic 
lambs and to place

in the con-

at aversive conditioning. 

Methods 

This study was conducted 
at the National Wildlife 
Research Center's Predator Research 
Facility near 
Logan, Utah. We transported 
20 Rambouillet 
lambs 
to 
the research 
site on 30 April 1997. We placed 
lambs 
in a pasture with 
shelter, feed, and water. 
We attempted 
to select 
that had 
captive 
coyotes 
previous 
experience 
killing 
lambs, were 
similar 
in 
age, and were not being used 
in other studies at the 
facility. We selected 
5 male and 4 female 
coyotes 
between 
5 and 9 years old. Male 5037 had previous 
experience 
attacking 
and wounding 
a 
lamb; 
the 
other coyotes 
previously were not allowed 
to attack

from 
the

closely 
approached

to bite 
it. We considered 
1 pur- 
suit to cease and another 
to begin 
if the former was 
interrupted 
by a shock(s). We defined 
1 attack as all 
that occurred within 
all pur- 
pursuits 
30 
seconds; 
suits that were part of the same predatory 
sequence 
occurred within 
this interval. We exposed 
individual 
lambs to coyotes 
on 1-3 days of trials and to 1-3 coy- 
otes on a given day if tested during the first 5 trial days 
and to all 5 coyotes 
if tested after the fifth trial day. We 
used logistic regression with a logit link and a binomi- 
al distribution (SAS Institute, Inc. 1993) to determine 
if 
the probability 
of an attack by the 5 coyotes 
during 
the first hour of testing decreased 
during the study. 

Results 

Four of 5 coyotes attempted 7 attacks on individ- 
ual lambs during the first trial on 13 or 14 May 
(Table 1). The 4 coyotes initially pursued lambs an 
average of 3.4 minutes (range=0.2-6.2 min) after 
being introduced into the test area. Coyote 5348 did 
not attempt an attack. Coyotes 5162 and 5157 
actively pursued lambs 2 and 4 times, respectively, 
within 20-second periods (defined as 1 attack each); 
we shocked both coyotes during each pursuit, and

occurred an average of >4 months before the end of 
the study (Table 1). 
Coyotes appeared to alter their behavior toward 
lambs in response to being shocked. During the first 
day (13 or 14 May) that each coyote attempted an 
attack, 7 of the attacks consisted of active chases of 
lambs, whereas 
1 (the 
second 
attack by coyote 
5366) consisted of a slow frontal approach. During 
subsequent trials, coyotes slowly approached lambs 
and attempted to bite or nip the flank area on 3 
occasions, quickly circled a lamb and attempted to 
bite the flank on 1 occasion, and ran at a stationary 
lamb on another occasion. During the first day each 
coyote attempted an attack, 3 of the attacks consist- 
ed of 2-4 consecutive chases that were interrupted 
with shocks; no consecutive chases occurred in subse- 
quent trials. Before being shocked, coyotes did not 
tend to avoid lambs, but after being shocked, they 
often avoided lambs and retreated when a lamb 
approached; during 2 retreats, coyotes 
5348 and 
5037 displayed submissive behaviors. 
Most shocks that we administered during active 
pursuits resulted in an immediate interruption of an 
attack. During slow approaches and flank bites or 
nips, coyotes quickly backed away from the lambs 
after being shocked. None of the coyotes contacted 
lambs immediately after being shocked. 

Discussion 

Coyotes appeared to quickly associate the shocks 
from 
the electronic 
collar with 
their attempted 
attacks on lambs. Our training sequence with the 
collar stopped all attempted attacks, and altered coy- 
ote behavior toward lambs by decreasing the proba- 
bility of an attempted attack, eliminating consecu- 
tive chases, causing switches from active pursuits to 
sneaking behind lambs and attempting to bite or nip 
the flank area, and causing avoidance of lambs. This 
reduction in attacks and the >4-month average dura- 
tion between the last attempted attack and the end 
of the study indicate that our approach to aversive 
conditioning had lasting effects. 
We believe prey-killing aversion can be most read- 
ily established by applying response-contingent 
aversive stimuli during the chase and attack phase of 
the predatory sequence (Burns and Connolly 1980), 
as in this study. In contrast, we believe that condi- 
tioned taste aversion (Gustavson et al. 1978) gener- 
ally has not led to rejection of live prey under prac- 
tical field applications (Burns and Connolly 1980, 
Burns 1983a) 
because 
coyotes 
apparently rely

both quickly 
recovered 
and continued 
active pur- 
suits until we administered 
the 
last shock. 
Coyote 
5366 pursued 
the 
lamb, was averted with a shock, 
the front of the lamb 21 minutes 
slowly approached 
later, and again was averted with 
a shock. 
Coyote 
the 
lamb, was averted with a shock, 
5037 pursued 
immediately pursued 
the lamb, and again was averted. 
This coyote pursued 
the lamb 2 and 86 minutes 
later 
and each 
time was averted. 
We retested 
the 5 coyotes 
on 14 or 15 May, 1 day 
after 
the 
first 
trial (Table 1). Two 
coyotes 
(5162, 
5037) did not pursue 
lambs. The coyote 
that 
(5348) 
did not attempt 
to attack a lamb on the previous day 
a lamb 9.8 minutes 
after the 
trial 
actively pursued 
began and was averted with a shock. 
Coyote 
5157 
a lamb from the rear and nipped 
slowly approached 
at the lamb's flank. Coyote 5366 slowly approached 
a lamb from 
the rear and suddenly 
seized 
it by the 
hock 
before we were 
aware 
that 
it was 
going 
to 
attack. We averted both 
attacks by an 
attempted 
electric 
shock, and neither 
lamb was 
injured by the 
coyotes. During the first week (on 15 May), we tested 
coyote 
5348 a third time and it did not attempt an 
attack. Only 3 attempted attacks by 3 different coyotes 
occurred during the remainder of the study, and each 
was averted by a shock 
from the training collar. The 
probability 
of an attempted 
attack by the 5 coyotes 
the first hour of testing decreased 
during 
(F=16.28; 
1,4 df; P=0.016) 
during the study (Table 1). To min- 
imize 
effects 
of 
potential 
confounding 
increasing 
size 
of 
lambs 
(5 
and 4 randomly 
selected 
lambs 
an average of 13.1 kg on 14 May and 32.9 
weighed 
kg on 
24 August 
1997) 
on 
the probability 
of an 
attack, we also analyzed 
the 
first month 
attempted 
of 
testing 
separately 
and 
found 
that 
attacks 
also 
decreased 
that 
during 
period 
(F=18.44; 
1,4 
df; 
P=0.013).

primarily on visual stimuli rather than taste and odor 
stimuli (Olsen and Lehner 1978, Wells and Lehner 
1978) when capturing prey, and thus may have dif- 
ficulty associating a live animal with an aversive bait. 
Our results and those of Linhart et al. (1976) dif- 
fer from Burns et al. (1984), who reported coyotes 
apparently did not learn to avoid sheep after receiv- 
ing repellent or aversive chemicals in neck collars. 
We suspect that these results differ because we and 
Linhart et al. (1976) conditioned most coyotes 2-6 
times with substantial response-contingent shocks 
during the pursuit of prey, whereas Burns et al. 
(1984) conditioned coyotes less frequently, post-inges- 
tional illness may have been a less severe stimulus, and 
application of the stimulus often was delayed until 
after the predatory event. Also, neck collars containing 
sublethal doses of sodium cyanide or capsicum oleo- 
resin on sheep or lambs were not effective to control 
coyote predation because coyotes redirected attacks at 
the sides and rear of lambs after puncturing a collar 
(Burns et al. 1984, Burns and Mason 1996). We noted 
that coyotes 
redirected their attacks after being 
shocked, but a major advantage of the electronic col- 
lar was that it allowed us to avert all attacks. 
We did not use a control group of coyotes during 
our study to better establish the duration of aversive 
conditioning, because of animal care and use con- 
cerns about allowing coyotes to kill a large number 
of lambs. To remove the potentially confounding 
effect of increasing size of lambs, separate control 
groups of 5 coyotes each would have been needed 
for testing during each of the 14 (or perhaps sever- 
al) trials so 
that treatment and control coyotes 
would have had similar experience killing lambs. To 
alleviate some of this concern, we noted that coy- 
otes 
significantly decreased 
the probability of 
attacks during the first month of testing when lambs 
did not grow substantially. Additionally, O'Gara et 
al. (1983) reported that coyotes continued killing 
lambs as they increased in size, and coyotes also 
killed adult ewes when lambs were present. 
In ret- 
rospect, if lambs become 
less vulnerable to coyote 
predation as they increase 
in size, then our aver- 
sive conditioning was still successful during the 
vulnerable period. 

Research and management 
recommendations 

Electronic training collars likely will have some- 
what limited applications for resolving conflicts with 
predators; the effectiveness of these applications 

will need 
to be 
confirmed 
in 
the 
field. 
Primary 
applications 
will be where 
the extent 
of depreda- 
tions or the value of the predator or the animals to 
be protected 
can justify the costs of equipment, 
cap- 
turing the predator, and possibly 
capturing 
the ani- 
mals to be protected. 
An electronic 
collar 
and 
unit will 
transmitting 
need 
to be 
developed 
for practical 
use 
in 
the 
field. The collar 
should 
retain battery 
for 
power 
an extended 
period 
of time, and should maintain 
contact with 
the predator without 
causing 
irrita- 
tion. The 
transmitting 
unit should 
be versatile 
so 
that 
it can be placed 
directly 
on 
the prey or at a 
fixed 
location 
so it automatically 
activates 
the col- 
lar as the predator 
approaches. 
Coupling 
a fright- 
stimulus 
to 
the 
event 
ening 
auditory 
shocking 
may encourage 
the predator 
to move 
away 
from 
the 
unit 
and may help 
the 
animal 
transmitting 
learn avoidance. 
A remote 
transmitting 
unit and 
electronic 
ear 
tag have 
been 
developed 
which 
meet 
some 
of the above 
characteristics 
(Quigley 
et al. 1995). 
Coyotes 
are territorial, 
such 
that a few 
individu- 
als have 
relatively 
exclusive 
access 
to 
lambs 
and 
other prey 
in those 
territories. 
This suggests 
that 
research 
is needed 
to ascertain 
if only a few 
indi- 
viduals 
need 
to be 
and aver- 
captured, 
collared, 
sively 
conditioned 
to 
protect 
lambs 
or 
endan- 
such 
as 
gered 
species 
black-footed 
ferrets 
(Mustela 
nigripes; 
Biggins 
et al. 1998) 
in 
those 
territories. 
Where 
coyotes 
kill 
large prey, adult 
males 
might 
be 
preferentially 
conditioned 
because 
2-yr-old males 
(Connolly 
et al. 1976) 
and 
alpha males 
(Gese 
and Grothe 
1995) were more 
prone 
to kill larger prey than were younger males, 
and coyotes 
of lower 
social 
status.

Coyotes without

or prey-killing

(Connolly 
However, 
the role of parental 
influence 
and social 
learning 
on prey selection may be important 
in coyotes, as it 
is in several other 
species 
(Bekoff 
1977, Heyes and 
Galef 
1996). 
Thus, 
research 
is needed

If such 
learning occurs, 
the aversive condi- 
tioning might have 
long-term effects. Research also 
is needed 
to ascertain 
if other predators, 
such 
as 
wolves 
(Canis 
lupus) 
that wander 
away from rein- 
troduction 
sites and kill livestock, black bears (Ursus 
americanus) 
that depredate 
apiaries and livestock, 
and possibly 
tigers 
(Panthera 
tigris) 
that prey on

to avoid certain prey.
