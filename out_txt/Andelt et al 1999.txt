Coyote Predation on Domestic Sheep Deterred with Electronic Dog-Training Collar


12 DETERRING COYOTE PREDATION ON SHEEP 

Coyote predation on domestic sheep 
deterred with electronic dog-training 

collar

Abstract Additional methods are needed to deter predators from killing livestock. We tested the 
effectiveness of an electronic dog-training collar to deter captive coyotes (Canis latrans) 
from killing domestic lambs by shocking coyotes whenever they attempted to attack 
lambs during a 22-week period. The collar averted all 13 attempted attacks on lambs 
by 5 coyotes, greatly reduced the probability of subsequent attempted attacks, and 
caused coyotes to avoid and retreat from lambs for over 4 months (F=16.28; 1,4 df; 
P=0.016). We believe this approach to aversive conditioning has potential to reduce 
coyote predation on domestic sheep in limited areas and may apply to a variety of other 
problems involving carnivore predation on domestic or endangered species.

Predators kill significant numbers of sheep, goats, 
and calves in the United States despite various types 
and intensities of predator management used by 
producers and professional wildlife managers to 
reduce depredations (National Agricultural Statistics 
Service 1991, 1995; Andelt 1996). With changing 
public sentiment about the way wildlife damage is 
managed and the loss of some lethal control tech- 
niques, additional methods are needed to manage 
predation on livestock by carnivores. 

Gustavson et al. (1974) proposed and tested con- 
ditioned taste aversion using lithium-chloride-treat- 
ed baits and carcasses to prevent coyotes (Canis 
latrans) from killing lambs. The effectiveness of this 
tactic has been intensively researched (Gustavson et 
al. 1974, Burns and Connolly 1980, Burns 1983a, 
Conover and Kessler 1994), and results have been 
controversial (Burns and Connolly 1985; Forthman 
Quick et al. 1985a, b; Lehner and Horn 1985). Our 

assessment of the research indicates that coyotes 
acquired bait aversions but generally did not devel- 
op an aversion to live prey after feeding on sickness- 
producing baits and carcasses. Various applications 
of aversive chemicals to the necks or bodies of 
sheep have been unsuccessful in establishing aver- 
sions to live prey in coyotes (Burns 1983b, Burns 
and Mason 1996). 

Linhart et al. (1976) used a prototype electronic 
collar to condition 3 of 4 coyotes to avoid black 
domestic rabbits while continuing to prey on white 
rabbits, and thus provided one of the few successful 
applications of aversive conditioning in coyotes. 
Electric shock has been used to establish aversions 
to visual and gustatory stimuli in albino rats (Krane 
and Wagner 1975). Electronic collars and electronic 
ear tags also have been used to train cattle to avoid 
certain portions of pastures, such as riparian areas 
(Quigley et al. 1990,Tiedemann et al. 1998). Our objec-

tives were to determine if an electronic dog-training 
collar could condition captive coyotes to stop killing 
domestic lambs and to place the results in the con- 
text of other attempts at aversive conditioning. 

Methods 
This study was conducted at the National Wildlife 

Research Center's Predator Research Facility near 
Logan, Utah. We transported 20 Rambouillet lambs 
to the research site on 30 April 1997. We placed 
lambs in a pasture with shelter, feed, and water. 

We attempted to select captive coyotes that had 
previous experience killing lambs, were similar in 
age, and were not being used in other studies at the 
facility. We selected 5 male and 4 female coyotes 
between 5 and 9 years old. Male 5037 had previous 
experience attacking and wounding a lamb; the 
other coyotes previously were not allowed to attack

lambs. On 5 May, we moved the 9 coyotes to indi- 
vidual 4.5-m2 kennels under an elevated observation 
tower from which we conducted observations of 
coyote-lamb interactions in a 679-m2, trapezoid- 
shaped enclosure. We released each of the 9 coyotes 
into the enclosure with 1 lamb during a 2-hour pre- 
trial period on 6 or 7 May 1997, to select at least 5 
coyotes that readily performed lethal attacks on 
lambs. Four males, but no females, attacked, killed, 
and partially consumed lambs during the initial peri- 
od, and the fifth male (5162) exhibited this behavior 
when it was solely retested on 13 May; we used 
these 5 males in our electronic collar trials. We pro- 
vided coyotes water ad libitum and fed them 1 
unskinned front or hind quarter of a lamb/day for 4 
days after killing the lamb in the pretrial to enhance 
experience with sheep as a food source. Thereafter, 
we fed coyotes approximately 600 g of commercial 
mink food daily; during electronic collar testing, we 
fed coyotes after the trials. 

We restrained coyotes by hand while we attached 
collars. On 6 and 7 May, we placed non-electronic 
"dummy" collars (Tri-Tronics, Tucson, Ariz., USA), 
which were the same size, shape, and weight as the 
test collar on the 4 coyotes that killed lambs (and on 
13 May we placed a "dummy" collar on the coyote 
that killed a lamb on 13 May), to acclimate them to 
the training collar. On the first day of electronic col- 
lar testing, we permanently removed the "dummy" 
collars and clipped the neck hair of coyotes to 
ensure that electrical contact with the electronic 
collar would be maintained throughout the study. 
Coyotes 5348 and 5366 were aggressive and difficult 
to handle, thus we gave them 0.5-1.5 ml of keta- 
mine hydrochloride to facilitate attaching and 
removing the collar 1-24 hours before trials and 
immediately after trials beginning on 15 and 20 May, 
respectively. Both coyotes appeared fully recovered 
from the effects of ketamine hydrochloride before 
we tested them with lambs. We used 1 Model 100 
Lite electronic dog-training collar (Tri-Tronics, Tuc- 
son, Ariz., USA), adjusted to deliver the maximum 
intensity shock; used the highest power setting on 
the radiotransmitter, which resulted in 325 
pulses/second of 600-640 volts and about 0.032 
ampere of instantaneous current (D. V'Marie, Tri- 
Tronics, Tucson, Ariz., USA, personal communica- 
tion); and removed the collar after each trial. 

We placed 1 lamb in the test area and a decoy 
lamb in a 1.0 x 0.75-m cage approximately 1 m out- 
side the enclosure to attract the test lamb to an eas- 
ily observed area. We tested each coyote during 2-

a Trials on 13-15 May were 2 hrs, whereas the other trials were 1 hr. 
b We tested coyotes on 2 consecutive days each week, except coyote 5348, which was tested on 3 consecutive days of the first 

week because it may have become fatigued on the first day when we struggled with it while attaching the electronic collar.

hour periods on 2 consecutive days (except coyote 
5348, which was tested on 3 consecutive days 
because it may have become fatigued when we 
struggled with it attaching the electronic collar on 
the first day) during the first week of our trials. We 
continued testing each coyote for a 1-hour period 
on each of 2 consecutive days during weeks 2,4,7, 
11, 16, and 22 to determine the duration of the aver- 
sive conditioning. We attempted to avert all attacks 
on the lamb during all trials by delivering a 1- to 3- 
second, continuous or briefly interrupted shock to 
the coyote each time it actively pursued and was 
within 5 m (usually within 2 m) of the lamb or when 
the coyote closely approached the lamb from the 
rear and attempted to bite it. We considered 1 pur- 
suit to cease and another to begin if the former was 
interrupted by a shock(s). We defined 1 attack as all 
pursuits that occurred within 30 seconds; all pur- 
suits that were part of the same predatory sequence 
occurred within this interval. We exposed individual 
lambs to coyotes on 1-3 days of trials and to 1-3 coy- 
otes on a given day if tested during the first 5 trial days 
and to all 5 coyotes if tested after the fifth trial day. We 
used logistic regression with a logit link and a binomi- 
al distribution (SAS Institute, Inc. 1993) to determine if 
the probability of an attack by the 5 coyotes during 
the first hour of testing decreased during the study. 

Results 
Four of 5 coyotes attempted 7 attacks on individ- 

ual lambs during the first trial on 13 or 14 May 
(Table 1). The 4 coyotes initially pursued lambs an 
average of 3.4 minutes (range=0.2-6.2 min) after 
being introduced into the test area. Coyote 5348 did 
not attempt an attack. Coyotes 5162 and 5157 
actively pursued lambs 2 and 4 times, respectively, 
within 20-second periods (defined as 1 attack each); 
we shocked both coyotes during each pursuit, and

both quickly recovered and continued active pur- 
suits until we administered the last shock. Coyote 
5366 pursued the lamb, was averted with a shock, 
slowly approached the front of the lamb 21 minutes 
later, and again was averted with a shock. Coyote 
5037 pursued the lamb, was averted with a shock, 
immediately pursued the lamb, and again was averted. 
This coyote pursued the lamb 2 and 86 minutes later 
and each time was averted. 

We retested the 5 coyotes on 14 or 15 May, 1 day 
after the first trial (Table 1). Two coyotes (5162, 
5037) did not pursue lambs. The coyote (5348) that 
did not attempt to attack a lamb on the previous day 
actively pursued a lamb 9.8 minutes after the trial 
began and was averted with a shock. Coyote 5157 
slowly approached a lamb from the rear and nipped 
at the lamb's flank. Coyote 5366 slowly approached 
a lamb from the rear and suddenly seized it by the 
hock before we were aware that it was going to 
attack. We averted both attempted attacks by an 
electric shock, and neither lamb was injured by the 
coyotes. During the first week (on 15 May), we tested 
coyote 5348 a third time and it did not attempt an 
attack. Only 3 attempted attacks by 3 different coyotes 
occurred during the remainder of the study, and each 
was averted by a shock from the training collar. The 
probability of an attempted attack by the 5 coyotes 
during the first hour of testing decreased (F=16.28; 
1,4 df; P=0.016) during the study (Table 1). To min- 
imize potential confounding effects of increasing 
size of lambs (5 and 4 randomly selected lambs 
weighed an average of 13.1 kg on 14 May and 32.9 
kg on 24 August 1997) on the probability of an 
attempted attack, we also analyzed the first month 
of testing separately and found that attacks also 
decreased during that period (F=18.44; 1,4 df; 
P=0.013). The last attempted attack by each coyote 

occurred an average of >4 months before the end of 
the study (Table 1). 

Coyotes appeared to alter their behavior toward 
lambs in response to being shocked. During the first 
day (13 or 14 May) that each coyote attempted an 
attack, 7 of the attacks consisted of active chases of 
lambs, whereas 1 (the second attack by coyote 
5366) consisted of a slow frontal approach. During 
subsequent trials, coyotes slowly approached lambs 
and attempted to bite or nip the flank area on 3 
occasions, quickly circled a lamb and attempted to 
bite the flank on 1 occasion, and ran at a stationary 
lamb on another occasion. During the first day each 
coyote attempted an attack, 3 of the attacks consist- 
ed of 2-4 consecutive chases that were interrupted 
with shocks; no consecutive chases occurred in subse- 
quent trials. Before being shocked, coyotes did not 
tend to avoid lambs, but after being shocked, they 
often avoided lambs and retreated when a lamb 
approached; during 2 retreats, coyotes 5348 and 
5037 displayed submissive behaviors. 

Most shocks that we administered during active 
pursuits resulted in an immediate interruption of an 
attack. During slow approaches and flank bites or 
nips, coyotes quickly backed away from the lambs 
after being shocked. None of the coyotes contacted 
lambs immediately after being shocked. 

Discussion 
Coyotes appeared to quickly associate the shocks 

from the electronic collar with their attempted 
attacks on lambs. Our training sequence with the 
collar stopped all attempted attacks, and altered coy- 
ote behavior toward lambs by decreasing the proba- 
bility of an attempted attack, eliminating consecu- 
tive chases, causing switches from active pursuits to 
sneaking behind lambs and attempting to bite or nip 
the flank area, and causing avoidance of lambs. This 
reduction in attacks and the >4-month average dura- 
tion between the last attempted attack and the end 
of the study indicate that our approach to aversive 
conditioning had lasting effects. 

We believe prey-killing aversion can be most read- 
ily established by applying response-contingent 
aversive stimuli during the chase and attack phase of 
the predatory sequence (Burns and Connolly 1980), 
as in this study. In contrast, we believe that condi- 
tioned taste aversion (Gustavson et al. 1978) gener- 
ally has not led to rejection of live prey under prac- 
tical field applications (Burns and Connolly 1980, 
Burns 1983a) because coyotes apparently rely 



16 Wildlife Society Bulletin 1999, 27(1):12-18 

primarily on visual stimuli rather than taste and odor 
stimuli (Olsen and Lehner 1978, Wells and Lehner 
1978) when capturing prey, and thus may have dif- 
ficulty associating a live animal with an aversive bait. 

Our results and those of Linhart et al. (1976) dif- 
fer from Burns et al. (1984), who reported coyotes 
apparently did not learn to avoid sheep after receiv- 
ing repellent or aversive chemicals in neck collars. 
We suspect that these results differ because we and 
Linhart et al. (1976) conditioned most coyotes 2-6 
times with substantial response-contingent shocks 
during the pursuit of prey, whereas Burns et al. 
(1984) conditioned coyotes less frequently, post-inges- 
tional illness may have been a less severe stimulus, and 
application of the stimulus often was delayed until 
after the predatory event. Also, neck collars containing 
sublethal doses of sodium cyanide or capsicum oleo- 
resin on sheep or lambs were not effective to control 
coyote predation because coyotes redirected attacks at 
the sides and rear of lambs after puncturing a collar 
(Burns et al. 1984, Burns and Mason 1996). We noted 
that coyotes redirected their attacks after being 
shocked, but a major advantage of the electronic col- 
lar was that it allowed us to avert all attacks. 

We did not use a control group of coyotes during 
our study to better establish the duration of aversive 
conditioning, because of animal care and use con- 
cerns about allowing coyotes to kill a large number 
of lambs. To remove the potentially confounding 
effect of increasing size of lambs, separate control 
groups of 5 coyotes each would have been needed 
for testing during each of the 14 (or perhaps sever- 
al) trials so that treatment and control coyotes 
would have had similar experience killing lambs. To 
alleviate some of this concern, we noted that coy- 
otes significantly decreased the probability of 
attacks during the first month of testing when lambs 
did not grow substantially. Additionally, O'Gara et 
al. (1983) reported that coyotes continued killing 
lambs as they increased in size, and coyotes also 
killed adult ewes when lambs were present. In ret- 
rospect, if lambs become less vulnerable to coyote 
predation as they increase in size, then our aver- 
sive conditioning was still successful during the 
vulnerable period. 

Research and management 
recommendations 

Electronic training collars likely will have some- 
what limited applications for resolving conflicts with 
predators; the effectiveness of these applications 

will need to be confirmed in the field. Primary 
applications will be where the extent of depreda- 
tions or the value of the predator or the animals to 
be protected can justify the costs of equipment, cap- 
turing the predator, and possibly capturing the ani- 
mals to be protected. 

An electronic collar and transmitting unit will 
need to be developed for practical use in the 
field. The collar should retain battery power for 
an extended period of time, and should maintain 
contact with the predator without causing irrita- 
tion. The transmitting unit should be versatile so 
that it can be placed directly on the prey or at a 
fixed location so it automatically activates the col- 
lar as the predator approaches. Coupling a fright- 
ening auditory stimulus to the shocking event 
may encourage the predator to move away from 
the transmitting unit and may help the animal 
learn avoidance. A remote transmitting unit and 
electronic ear tag have been developed which 
meet some of the above characteristics (Quigley 
et al. 1995). 

Coyotes are territorial, such that a few individu- 
als have relatively exclusive access to lambs and 
other prey in those territories. This suggests that 
research is needed to ascertain if only a few indi- 
viduals need to be captured, collared, and aver- 
sively conditioned to protect lambs or endan- 
gered species such as black-footed ferrets 
(Mustela nigripes; Biggins et al. 1998) in those 
territories. Where coyotes kill large prey, adult 
males might be preferentially conditioned 
because 2-yr-old males (Connolly et al. 1976) and 
alpha males (Gese and Grothe 1995) were more 
prone to kill larger prey than were younger males, 
females, and coyotes of lower social status. 

Coyotes without hunting or prey-killing experi- 
ence kill sheep (Connolly et al. 1976). However, 
the role of parental influence and social learning 
on prey selection may be important in coyotes, as it 
is in several other species (Bekoff 1977, Heyes and 
Galef 1996). Thus, research is needed to deter- 
mine if pups of conditioned coyotes will learn, 
through parental facilitation or observational learn- 
ing (Sterner 1997), to avoid sheep and endangered 
species. If such learning occurs, the aversive condi- 
tioning might have long-term effects. Research also 
is needed to ascertain if other predators, such as 
wolves (Canis lupus) that wander away from rein- 
troduction sites and kill livestock, black bears (Ursus 
americanus) that depredate apiaries and livestock, 
and possibly tigers (Panthera tigris) that prey on

humans in southern Asia (McDougal 1987, Sanyal 
1987), might be conditioned to avoid certain prey.

William F. (Bill) Andelt 
(photo) has B.S. (1974) and 
M.S. (1976) degrees in 
wildlife sciences from the 
University of Nebraska and a 
Ph.D. (1982) in zoology from 
Colorado State University. 
Bill's interests include re- 
search and extension related 
to managing human-wildlife 
conflicts and the ecology of 
carnivores. Robert L. (Bob) 
Phillips recently retired from 
his position as a wildlife 
research biologist with the 
United States Department of 
Agriculture's National Wildlife 
Research Center. He holds an 
M.S. degree in wildlife biolo- 

gy from Utah State University. His research focused on the 
development and improvement of tools used for resolving live- 
stock depredation problems. Kenneth S. Gruver is a wildlife 
biologist and Jerry W. Guthrie is a biological technician, both 
with the United States Department of Agriculture's National 
Wildlife Research Center. Ken and Jerry received B.S. and 
M.S. degrees in wildlife management from Sul Ross State Uni- 
versity, and both worked as animal damage control special- 
ists for the Texas Animal Damage Control program (now 
called Wildlife Services) prior to joining the National Wildlife 
Research Center.
