Abstract:  The general public often prefers non-lethality when dealing with problem 

black bears (Ursus americanus).  We evaluated the efficacy of bear deterrent techniques 

in the Lake Tahoe Basin of the Sierra-Nevada range by contrasting animals randomly 

assigned to an experimental (treatment) or to a control (no treatment) group.   

Experimental bears were pepper sprayed, shot with 12-gauge rubber buckshot and a 



Beckmann et al. 2 

rubber slug, and exposed to cracker shells.  Additionally, half the bears that received the 

treatment were chased by both hounds and Karelian bear dogs.  We modeled the 

effectiveness of deterrents using a survival analysis utilizing Cox proportional hazards. 

Relative success was evaluated by the latency of time between treatment and return 

(days) to the urban patch (RUP).  Predictor variables in the model included: age, weight, 

season, gender, distance moved, treatment/control, dogs, and prior experience with the 

treatment.  Only the use of dogs remained in the most parsimonious model.  The mean 

number of days (154) until RUP after being chased by dogs was three times that for bears 

lacking the dog treatment (55 days).  Nevertheless, in all but 5 cases of 62 possible, bears 

eventually returned to the urban patch and 33 of 62 bears (53%) returned within 1 month.  

We conclude that in the Lake Tahoe Basin the most common deterrents, other than dogs, 

currently used by agencies responsible for the management of black bears are not 

effective at altering their behavior over periods of time >1 month.

During the last 10-20 years many areas have experienced an increase in the 

number of conflicts between black bears and humans, and such conflicts have been 

disproportional to human population growth.  This is especially true in western North 

America where rapid urban sprawl has led to encroachment into areas adjacent to U.S. 

public lands that have historically contained large carnivores.  In Nevada, as in other 

areas of western North America, human-bear interactions involve the loss of pets, 

localized predation on livestock, property damage, and even human deaths 

(approximately 40 from black bears since 1900 in North America).  Many state and 



Beckmann et al. 3 

federal entities seek non-lethal solutions (i.e., deterrents) for dealing with ‘nuisance’ 

carnivores, especially black bears.  Deterrents such as lithium chloride, protection collars, 

and loud noises, have been tested on other species of carnivores, mostly coyotes (Canis 

latrans) (Giffiths et al. 1978, Burns 1983, Jelinski et al. 1983, Burns et al. 1996).  Yet, 

there is a paucity of rigorous study of the effectiveness of the most common deterrent 

techniques management agencies currently use to alter the behavior of ‘nuisance’ bears, 

although exceptions clearly exist (e.g., Gilllin et al. 1994, Ternent and Garshelis 1999, 

Clark et al. 2002).    

A survey conducted by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries in 

2001 revealed that 33 states currently manage black bears and respond to citizen 

complaints about ‘nuisance’ bears (D. Kocka, Virginia Department of Game and Inland 

Fisheries, personal communication).  Of those, 26 administer deterrent techniques with 

the aim of behavioral alteration of ‘nuisance’ individuals.  The use of deterrent 

techniques, although not a new management tool, has been increasing rapidly in both 

Canada and the USA, primarily in response to the public’s request for non-lethal 

management of bears near urban-wildland interface areas.  Fifteen of 26 states that 

currently utilize deterrents began in the 1990s (D. Kocka, Virginia Department of Game 

and Inland Fisheries, personal communication).  In contrast, only 4 states administered 

deterrents in the 1960s and 1970s.  The 6 most common techniques used on trapped 

bears, according to the 33 states surveyed, are: 1) rubber buckshot; 2) rubber slugs; 3) 

pepper spray; 4) cracker shells; 5) dogs; and 6) loud noises (D. Kocka, Virginia 

Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, personal communication).  Although many 

states and other entities, such as national parks (e.g., Yosemite National Park, California), 



Beckmann et al. 4 

spend many dollars on an annual basis for such deterrents, to date no research has 

rigorously analyzed the efficacy of these deterrents.  

We capitalized on the extent to which human population growth and their 

coincident food stores in the Lake Tahoe Basin in the Sierra-Nevada Range in western 

Nevada offer an experimental setting in which to examine the effectiveness of deterrent 

techniques on behavior of black bears.  From 1990-2000 the human population in the 

Lake Tahoe Basin increased by 26% and the number of complaints by citizens 

concerning black bears increased by >10-fold during the same time period.  Our goal here 

is modest, to examine the effectiveness of the 6 most common deterrents used on black 

bears.  

Methods 

Black bear distribution in Nevada is restricted to the Sierra-Nevada and near-by 

mountains that include the Sweetwater, Pine Nut, and Wassuk Ranges (Goodrich 1990), 

all of which were the focus of our work.  Bears in this region are at the eastern edge of 

their known range in the Great Basin with the closest population to the east being about 

750 km away in Utah.  Although black bears are listed as a game species in Nevada, there 

has never been a legal harvest. 

Bears were captured in culvert traps (Teton Welding, Chateau, Montana) and by 

tranquilizing free-ranging individuals from 1 July 1997 to 1 April 2002 and immobilized 

with a mixture of Telazol/Xylazine.  Each bear was weighed and radio-collars with 

mortality sensors were attached to adults (Advanced Telemetry Systems, Isanti, 

Minnesota).  Age was estimated from annuli of the first upper premolar (PM1), the 

standard tooth for age analysis in black bears (Matson’s Laboratory, Milltown, Montana; 



Beckmann et al. 5 

Stoneberg and Jonkel 1966) and animals were classified as cubs (<1.5 years), juveniles 

(1.5-3 years) or adults (> 3 years).  

We tested the effectiveness of the 6 most common deterrents utilized by state 

agencies across the USA (see above).  Sixty-two collared bears captured in urban areas in 

the Lake Tahoe Basin of the Sierra-Nevada were randomly assigned to an experimental 

group, which received deterrents (treatment), or to a control group (no treatment).  The 

experimental treatment consisted of bears being hit with pepper spray, 12-gauge rubber 

buckshot and a rubber slug, and being exposed to cracker shells and yelling.   In addition, 

half the bears in the treatment group were chased by hounds or Karelian bear dogs.  

Individual bears were moved varying distances from the capture site for the 

administration of deterrents.  These distances ranged from zero km (on-site release) to 75 

km and distance was included as a continuous variable in the model.   

We measured effectiveness as time (in days) required between treatment and for 

the bear to ‘return to urban patch’, designated as RUP.  Animals were located weekly, 

weather permitting, from a Cessna 206 fixed-wing airplane, and from the ground 

( X number of locations per individual + 1SD = 105 + 39).  Most flights occurred from 0500 to 1600 

Pacific Standard Time.  We assigned Universal Transverse Mercator coordinates to each 

location from a global positioning system unit on-board the aircraft.  All locations were 

entered into coverage maps and urban areas were defined by town and city delineation in 

ArcView 3.2.  If an individual’s RUP was separated by the approximately weeklong 

interval between flights, we averaged date of return.   The time interval between flights 

never exceeded two weeks.   

Statistical analyses 



Beckmann et al. 6 

We modeled the effectiveness of deterrents using a multivariate approach that 

included a survival analysis utilizing a Cox proportional hazards model (through PROC 

PHREG in SAS statistical software; SAS Institute 2001).  The analysis of survival data, 

in this case time to return (i.e., ‘failure’ or ‘death’), requires special techniques because 

the data are almost always incomplete, and thus parametric assumptions may be 

unjustifiable.  For example, in our case, 5 individuals failed to RUP at the time of our 

analyses and thus, beyond that time their status was ‘unknown’.  The problem is onerous 

because, the 5 bears may never come back, or they could return at any unknown future 

time. These 5 survival times, which comprised 8% of the observations, were censored.  

The remaining 57 bears were non-censored survival times and were referred to as event 

times.  Methods for survival analysis, such as the proportional hazard regression model 

reported here, must account for both censored and non-censored data.  The Cox 

proportional hazards model is an excellent tool for making inferences on the population 

average effect of covariates on incomplete failure time data.   

Predictor variables in the full model included: age, weight, season, gender, 

distance moved, treatment/control, dogs, and previous number of experiences with the 

treatment.  Categorical predictor variables were assigned dummy variables for the 

purpose of the proportional hazard regression model.  All possible models for each 

number of parameters (i.e., 8,7,6,5,4,3,2, and 1) were examined.  We compared 255 

potential models beginning with the saturated 2-way interactive model using information-

theoretic methods to direct model selection.  For each model we calculated Akaike 

information criteria (AIC) and adjusted these for small sample sizes (AICc) as suggested 

by Hurvich and Tsai (1989) and Anderson et al. (1994).  These values (AICc) were used 



Beckmann et al. 7 

to compare candidate models to achieve the most parsimonious one that accurately 

represented the data (Anderson et al. 2000).  We also utilized the application of a 

bootstrap technique in PROC PHREG (SAS Institute 2001) to estimate the survival curve 

of individuals 1) in treatment versus controls; and 2) within the treatment that were 

chased by dogs and were not.  Means + 1SD are presented unless otherwise noted. 

Results 

In 57 of the 62 cases that bears were released, the individuals returned back to the 

urban patch by the point in time of the analysis.  Of the 62 bears, 33 (53%) returned in 

less than 1 month (30 days), 17 (27%) returned between 31 and 180 days, 7 (11%) 

returned between 181 and 365 days, and 5 (9%) were gone for >365 days.  The latency of 

RUP varied significantly, but only the use of dogs fit in the most parsimonious model 

(hazard ratiodogs = 0.454; P = 0.0061; Figure 1; Table 1).  RUP was greater when chased 

by dogs ( X days = 154 + 202; range 5-641 days) than in their absence ( X days = 55 + 83; 

range 1-283 days).  Dogs chased individuals in 4 of the 5 cases in which they had yet to 

‘fail’ (i.e., return) at time of the analysis.  The mean number of days that had elapsed 

between the deterrent and time of analysis for the 5 bears that had not yet ‘failed’ was 

481 days (range 224-641 days).  In all 255 possible models, none of the other predictor 

variables or any interactions accounted for a significant amount of the variation in RUP.   

However, mean RUP was slightly greater when deterrents were given ( X days = 104 + 

165; range 1-641 days) than that for the control group ( X days = 71 + 102; range 2-283 

days; Figure 2). 

Discussion 



Beckmann et al. 8 

In our analyses, we included 8 ecological and biological parameters of individuals 

that, a priori, we believed might prove relevant.  Our analysis revealed that 92% of the 

time, black bears exposed to deterrents returned to the urban patch.  Although ideally, it 

would be wonderful if treated bears did not return, the more realistic issue is not whether 

bears return but when.  Our data indicate that 70% of the bears returned in <40 days.  

Based on our assessment of 8 ecological and biological parameters, we were unable to 

produce a model that allowed us to predict which individuals and under what 

circumstances deterrents would be a useful management strategy.  However, the use of 

deterrents did slightly shift the probability curve for not failing (i.e., not returning) for 

bears by delaying the time until RUP (Figure 2).      

The only significant variable that affected RUP was the use of dogs.  Bears 

chased by either hounds or Karelian bear dogs returned approximately 100 days later on 

average than bears that were not chased by dogs.  The use of dogs in combination with 

the other 6 deterrents did significantly alter the ‘return curve’ (RUP) (Figure 1).  

However, an indication that even dogs may not be an effective deterrent is that of the 

tremendous variation in RUP. 

There are obvious limitations in approaches that involve study of large wild 

carnivores.   First, although 62 collared individuals may be a decent sample, larger ones 

will have to be used to have adequate power to detect the true effectiveness of some 

deterrents.  Second, with 62 bears we were unable to establish a group that received only 

dogs without the other deterrents, as this would have created too many categories for the 

limited sample.  Additional research in the area of deterrents on black bears should 

examine the effectiveness of dogs when used alone. 



Beckmann et al. 9 

We recommend that any group that deals with ‘nuisance’ black bears conduct a 

serious cost/benefit analysis to decide if monetary investments in deterrents are worth it.  

If, a priori, agencies define success of deterrents as never having to deal with a 

‘nuisance’ bear again, then our data suggest that this objective will most likely always be 

met with failure.  If the goal is to establish positive public relations or not having to deal 

with an individual bear for several weeks or months, then the use of deterrents may be an 

effective management tool.  The Nevada Division of Wildlife has had far fewer negative 

responses from the local media and public in the Lake Tahoe Basin as the result of the 

use of non-lethal deterrents compared to the time period before these techniques were in 

use in their management of bears (C. Healy, Nevada Division of Wildlife, personal 

communication).  The use of non-lethal deterrents may have the added benefit of 

increasing public awareness of human-bear conflicts that are created through the 

availability of urban food sources in the form of garbage.  For example, two homeowner 

associations and a private campground at the south shore of Lake Tahoe spent a 

combined $100,000 on 350 bear-proof garbage containers in response to the use of non-

lethal deterrents on bears in Nevada (M. Paulson, Tahoe Village Homeowners 

Association, personal communication).   

Management implications 

 Our results indicate that the most commonly used deterrents to alter the behavior 

of ‘nuisance’ black bears: 1) rubber buckshot; 2) rubber slugs; 3) pepper spray; 4) cracker 

shells; and 5) loud noises, are not effective at altering the behavior of bears.  The only 

significant factor in RUP was the use of dogs.  We recommend that management 

agencies that deal with ‘nuisance’ black bears pursue non-lethal strategies or programs by 



Beckmann et al. 10 

incorporation of hounds, Karelian bear dogs, or both.  Bears that are both human-food 

(i.e., garbage) conditioned and habituated to living near or in urban-wildland interface 

areas are unlikely to alter their behavior in response to the deterrent techniques currently 

adopted by most state and federal agencies.  A more effective strategy to reduce human-

bear conflicts is to begin aggressive public education, as is being done in numerous areas, 

states, and parks.  Also, areas that contain black bears should pass laws, ordinances, and 

regulations against the intentional or non-intentional feeding of bears or any wildlife that 

may inadvertently bring bears into an area.  These areas should pass ordinances requiring 

private landowners and businesses to obtain and use bear-proof garbage containers.
