Abstract
Context.Conserving large carnivores can be challenging because of conflicts with human land use and competition with

humans for resources. Predation on domestic stock can have negative economic impacts particularly for owners of small
herds, and tools for minimising carnivore depredation of livestock are needed. Canids use scent marking to establish
territories and avoid intraspecific conflict. Exploiting scent-marking behaviour may provide ameans for manipulating canid
movements.

Aims.Wehypothesised that human-deployed scentmarks (i.e. ‘biofence’) could be used tomanipulate themovements of
grey wolves (Canis lupus) in Idaho, USA.

Methods. We deployed 65 km of biofence within three wolf-pack territories during summer 2010 and 2011 and used
location data from satellite-collared wolves and sign surveys to assess the effectiveness of biofencing.

Key results. Location data provided by satellite-collared wolves and sign surveys in 2010 showed little to no trespass of
the biofence, even though the excluded areas were used by the packs in previous summers. We also opportunistically
deployed a biofence in between a rendezvous site of a resident pack and a nearby sheep grazing allotment; the pack was
not implicated in any depredations in summer 2010, even though they had killed sheep every year since 2006. Location data
provided by satellite-collared wolves in summer 2011 showed that wolves did trespass biofences.

Conclusions. Biofencing effectively manipulated the movements of wolves in the first year of our study, but not the
second.

Implications.Our work suggests that biofencing may be most limited by the apparent necessity to maintain a continuous
presence once the biofence is established. The inherent labour and costs associatedwith such effortsmay limit the usefulness
of biofencing. Our work can be improved on through further testing that maintains biofencing over a longer timeframe
(>3 months), samples several animals per treatment pack, and uses a treatment and control design.

Introduction

Conserving large carnivores can be challenging because of
conflicts with human land use and direct competition with
humans for resources. Wild canids, in particular, have a long
history of associatingwith humans (Zimen 1981;Robinson 2005;
Hayes 2010); however, conflict arosemost notably when herding
societies began to form and humans provided a new source of
relatively docile livestock prey for large carnivores (Reynolds
and Tapper 1996). Currently, much of the conflict between
humans and canids arises from canid predation on domestic
stock (Sillero-Zubiri et al. 2004). Predation on domestic stock
can have negative economic impacts (Sillero-Zubiri et al. 2004),
although Berger (2006) did not detect negative impacts at an
industry-wide scale when analysing effects of coyote (C. latrans)
depredation on sheep (Ovis spp.) production. For individual
stock growers, particularly families in developing countries,
the loss of livestock can have severe negative impacts. Further,
predation on livestock creates a social environment where the
benefits of conserving large carnivores are not apparent to

people living with them on a daily basis. Numerous imperiled
canid species occupy landscapes where humans and livestock
are abundant, the potential for conflict is large, and the
conservation challenge is great (Macdonald and Sillero-Zubiri
2004).

Some strategies exist for mitigating canid predation on
livestock, including lethal techniques such as eradication,
population reduction and selective lethal removal (Treves and
Naughton-Treves 2005). Existing non-lethal tools include
increased vigilance, relocation of offending animals, fladry,
hazing, radio-activated guard (RAG) boxes, fencing, guard
dogs and llamas, and covering stock with unpalatable
substances (Nickel 1993; Green et al. 1994; Breck et al. 2002;
Musiani et al. 2003; Bradley et al. 2005; Gehring et al. 2010). All
of these methods have been tested to some extent on both wolves
and coyotes in North America, with most producing temporarily
effective, or generally ineffective, results. Although canids will
avoid new objects in their environment, their ability to rapidly
learn about and accept these objects (e.g. RAG boxes, fladry) is

commonly observed. A non-lethal method to reduce canid and
livestock conflicts is needed that does not rely on hazing,
translocation, or a short-lived frightening device, yet
effectively deters depredations.

The scent-marking behaviour of wild canids provides an
opportunity to develop a non-lethal tool that can be used to
mitigate the canid–livestock conflict. Wild canids will often
use chemicals to transfer information between individuals via
scent marking. Scent marking involves deposition of urine or
scat at a prominent landmark or trail junction (Barja et al. 2004),
sometimes over another individual’s scent mark (i.e. over-
marking). Scent marks contain pheromones, chemical signals
that elicit responses from other individuals. Pheromones are
substantially different from auditory or visual forms of
communication because they can remain in the environment
for extended periods of time, are effective even at night, and
can transmit their message around objects (Feldhamer et al.
2004). Canids, particularly dominant individuals (Rothman
and Mech 1979), routinely use scent marks to maintain
territories and avoid conflict. Moorcroft et al. (1999) showed
that coyotes maintained territories and moved away from
foreign scent marks of adjacent packs. Peterson (1977)
reported that wolves on Isle Royale reversed direction of travel
and retreated when they encountered a foreign scent mark along
the edge of their territory. Scent marks are routinely maintained
and are so important to territory maintenance that coyotes in
Yellowstone National Park usurped the territory of an adjacent
pack within 3 days of the death of one of the a animals of the
adjacent pack (Gese 1998). Additionally, Rothman and Mech
(1979) observed that lone wolves, in an apparent attempt to go
undetected by resident wolves, seldom scent marked along
roads and trails when dispersing through occupied wolf habitat.
Because canids are generally territorial, we hypothesised that
their movements could be manipulated by constructing
‘biofences’ made of conspecific scent marks. Our objective
was to manipulate grey wolf movements using human-
distributed scent marks in central Idaho, USA, during
summers 2010 and 2011. We predicted that the use of portions
of wolf territories excluded by biofencing would decrease
after biofence deployment.

Materials and methods
Study area

We tested the effectiveness of biofencing near Garden Valley,
Idaho, USA, from June to August 2010 and 2011. The study area
is mountainous and is dominated by a mix of ponderosa pine
(Pinus ponderosa), lodgepole pine (P. contorta) and spruce
(Picea englemannii) forests. Annual precipitation ranges from
89 to 178 cm and temperatures range from �34�C in winter to
38�C in summer (Western Regional Climate Center 2011).

Field methods

We evaluated biofencing in three wolf packs (Archie Mountain,
Timberline and Wapiti packs) that fluctuated between 8 and 14
individuals andwhose annual movements werewell documented
(USA Fish and Wildlife Service 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009).
These three packs occupied a core area of wolf habitat in central

Idaho where pack territories are contiguous and wolf density is
relatively high (~12 wolves per 1000 km2; Stenglein et al. 2010).
Location data from GPS-collared wolves in each pack provided
from three to four locations per wolf each day. Several major
roads and trails bisected the territories of these packs and
provided reasonable access for deploying biofences and for
sampling wolf signs. We wanted to select areas for biofencing
that we could reasonably assume the pack would normally use
if the biofence were not in place. We, therefore, mapped 2008
and 2009 summer (from 15 May to 15 September) location data
for satellite-collared wolves (Archie 2008, n= 3; Archie 2009,
n = 4; Timberline 2008, n = 2; Timberline 2009, n= 4; Wapiti
2009,n = 3) in the threewolf packs (only 2009datawere available
for Wapiti). To supplement knowledge from local biologists
about pack movements and habits, we pooled location data
from collared wolves in each pack and used Home Range
Tools in ArcGIS 9.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA) to generate
a kernel-density estimator (smoothing parameter = 80% of href)
andquantitatively determine areas usedby the residentwolf packs
during two summers (except Wapiti pack, where just 1 year of
data existed).We did not think that biofencingwould be effective
atmanipulatingwolfmovements in the core of their territory.We,
therefore, selected areas in the territories with >50% kernel
density estimates and reasonable access for sampling, as
candidates for biofencing. In early June 2010, we placed
biofences that began at the 75% kernel-estimate areas of use
and radiated out to the territory edge. We altered the Wapiti and
Timberline biofences slightly in early June 2011, to attempt to
achieve independence between years. We constructed theWapiti
biofence, beginning at the 50% kernel-estimate areas of use and
altered the Timberline biofence to begin at the 75% kernel
estimate, to exclude more of their territory and bisect the 50%
and 75% kernel-estimate areas of use (Figs 1–5). The Archie
Mountain biofence remained the same in both years, to avoid
potential interferencewith ongoing elk (Cervus elaphus) research
in the area. In addition, we opportunistically placed a biofence in
2010 between the rendezvous site of Timberline wolf pack and a
band of domestic sheep (n= 2400) at a distance of <1.6 km. This
area began at the edge of the estimated 50% kernel-density core
area of the pack.

We used scats and urine from wolves other than those in the
resident pack when constructing our biofences, although we
could not feasibly control for the sex and status of the wolves
whose scats we collected. In winter 2009/2010, we collected
scats from three wolf packs in western Montana where we had
detailed knowledge of their historic movements and use of road
and trail systems, specifically the Deborgia, Dutch and Ninemile
wolf packs. In winter 2010/2011, we collected scats from the
Big Hole, Dutch and Ninemile wolf packs in western Montana
(30 8-h days each winter). We placed scats in individual plastic
bags and labelled them by pack origin. We purchased wolf urine
($60US L–1) from Leg Up Enterprises (Lovell, ME, USA). To
create scratch marks, we initially used wolf paws collected by
Idaho Department of Fish and Game from dead 42-kg and 41-kg
male wolves, both of unknown pack status. We were unable to
keep wolf paws from degrading in the field and, beginning in
mid-summer 2010 through 2011, we placed a piece of scat on the
tip of a stick and scratched the ground with the stick to simulate
scratch marks.

Each biofence consisted of a primary line of scent marks and
a parallel secondary line that was offset from placement of marks
in the primary line (at a 45� angle, and a distance of 100m). To
create scent marks for our biofences, we simulated four
behaviours used by wolves when marking territories, including
raised-leg urinations (RLUs), squat urinations (SQUs), scats and
scratch marks accompanied by a RLU and scat. We placed RLUs
approximately every 500m by spraying a stream of 3.0mL
of urine at 30.5-cm height on a rock or other prominent object.
We deployed SQUs approximately every 750m, using 6.0mL
of urine sprayed directly onto the ground, and placed scats
approximately every 1 km. We deployed scratch marks
approximately every 2 km by depositing a scat at the base of a

prominent object, spraying the object with an RLU, and then
scratching the ground 1.2m from the scat, throwing dirt towards
the excrement. We also overmarked any observed scats from
resident wolves with a RLU. We inserted toothpicks 75% into
deployed scats to allow us to detect scats that may have been
deposited as overmarks by resident wolves. We recorded
simulated scent mark locations with a GPS and wrote a brief
description of each site. Scats collected from a single pack in
western Montana were deployed in a single pack in Idaho (e.g.
scats from the Dutch pack in Montana were the only scats
deployed in the territory of Timberline pack in Idaho). From
early June to late August, we refreshed simulated scent marks
between 10 and 14 days and recorded whether resident wolves

had investigated (via tracks present at scent mark) or overmarked
the marks (Rothman and Mech 1979; Gese 1998; Jedrzejewski
et al. 2001; Mech and Boitani 2003).

We used a combination of metrics to assess the effectiveness
of our biofencing. First, we used location data provided by
satellite collars in Archie Mountain (n = 1 in 2010, n = 2 in
2011), Timberline (n = 2 in 2011) and Wapiti (n = 2 in 2010,
n = 3 in 2011) wolf packs to summarise the number of trespass
locations across biofences. Some level of territorial trespass is
common in wolf packs (Mech and Boitani 2003). Historically,
the percentage of locations of wolves in Idaho that trespassed
into the territory of an adjacent pack ranged from 0.6% to 10.0%
and wolves were not detected farther than 2.8 km into the

territory of the adjacent pack (D. Ausband, unpubl. data).
Trespass distance was calculated as the shortest straight-line
distance to thebiofence. Second, becausewe experienced a large
number of collar failures, we conducted sign surveys at 20
potential rendezvous sites (Ausband et al. 2010) in the exclusion
areas created by our biofencing in the territories of Archie
Mountain and Timberline packs. Technicians went to highly
suitable rendezvous-site habitat, gave a series of wolf howls,
then surveyed each site for�30min to look for tracks and scat.
Third, because of the particular history and proximity to sheep
of the pack, we assessed whether the Timberline wolf pack
was implicated in any sheep depredations while the biofences
were deployed.

Effort of biofence deployment

In 2010, we deployed 19.2 km of biofence in Archie Mountain,
35.7 km in Timberline and 9.8 km in Wapiti wolf-pack
territories, using 440 scats collected in winter 2009/2010 and
11.4 L of urine. In 2011, we deployed 21.8 km of biofence in
Archie Mountain, 23.0 km in Timberline and 20.0 km inWapiti
wolf-pack territories.We deployed 505 scats collected in winter
2010/2011 and 12.0 L of urine. Scat collection was most
efficient in late spring when snow began to melt and scats
deposited over winter were observable yet still intact. While

deploying the biofences in 2010, we overmarked 27 resident
wolf scats on the primary line and six resident wolf scats on the
secondary line. In 2011, we overmarked 65 resident wolf
scats on the primary line and two resident wolf scats on the
secondary line while deploying the biofences. Resident
wolves overmarked, or investigated, 6.1% of components on
the primary line and 2.8% on the secondary line of the
biofences in 2010, whereas in 2011, they overmarked or
investigated 5.7% of components on the primary line and
1.1% of components on the secondary line. It is difficult to
detect RLU or SQU overmarks without snow cover and it is
likely that some urine overmarks went undetected both years.

For both years, it took two technicians 1 day to deploy an
average of 5.1 km and 1 day to refresh an average of 7.7 km
of two-walled biofence.

Biofence effectiveness in Summer 2010

Location data from satellite-collared wolves in the Wapiti pack
indicated no trespass of our biofences in 2010 (Table 1, Fig. 1).
The collared wolf in the Archie Mountain pack had nine
locations in the exclusion area, although the trespass distance
was very short (average = 0.46, range 0.29–0.65 km), as was
the average maximum duration of 17.5 h (range �15–22.5 h;
Table 1, Fig. 2). This resident Archie wolf trespassed 10 days

after the biofence was refreshed (s.e. = 1.4 days, range
5–14 days). Sign surveys in 2010 yielded wolf scat at 20% of
potential rendezvous sites in areas excluded by our biofences,
although these scats (n = 4) appeared old (i.e. crumbly and
chalky, or consisting of mostly hair, with little fecal matter
present) and were likely deposited before biofence deployment.
We detected seven incidental scats while travelling to the
predicted rendezvous sites. These seven scats were clustered
(1.3-km radius), appeared old and were 4.0 km from the den
site of the resident pack used in the spring. We did not detect
tracks or obtain howl responses at the 20 predicted rendezvous
sites. The Timberline wolf pack did not depredate sheep during
Summer 2010.

Biofence effectiveness in Summer 2011

In 2011, the collared wolves in the Wapiti pack showed
limited trespassing, with seven trespasses averaging 1.87 km
(s.e. = 0.87 km, range�0.10–3.45 km) and an average maximum
duration of 22.5 h (range�15–30 h;Table 1, Fig. 3). The satellite-
collared Archie Mountain wolves indicated no trespass of our
biofences (Fig. 4), whereas the satellite-collared Timberline
wolves trespassed 85 times, with an average distance of 1.56 km
(s.e. = 0.29 km, range �0.87–6.90 km) and average maximum
duration of 27.8 h (range �1.5–108.5 h; Table 1, Fig. 5).

Similar to 2010, most trespassing of biofences occurred
approximately 1 week or more after the biofence was

refreshed. In 2011, resident wolves in the Wapiti and
Timberline wolf packs trespassed 6 days after the biofences
were refreshed. Wapiti wolves trespassed an average of
6.8 days after refreshment (s.e. = 1.0 days, range 4–9 days) and
Timberline wolves trespassed an average of 6.3 days after
refreshment (s.e = 0.3 days, range 1–13 days).

Discussion

Results from 2010 suggested that the movements of wolves
could be manipulated with biofencing; however, the results in
2011 indicated that biofencing did not have a measurable
effect on wolf-pack movements. In 2010, both location and

Biofence and wolf movement Wildlife Research 213



sign-survey data indicated that resident wolf packs showed
limited use of the exclusion areas. Overmark and collar-
location data suggested these wolves approached the biofence,
and even walked along it, but then returned in a direction towards
the centre of their territory rather than trespass the biofence. In
2011, however, the wolves, particularly the Timberlinea female,
showed little aversion to trespassing the biofence. For most
wolves, both the distance and duration of the trespasses
we observed in both years were relatively short and within the
normal range of trespass reported for neighbouring packs
(Mech and Boitani 2003). Brief trespassing events may
explain why sign and howling surveys indicated little to no
wolf use of portions of the resident-wolf territories excluded
by the biofences in 2010. For example, we observed no tracks in
the exclusion areas in 2010, despite a historic track-detection rate
of 18.8% at sites in this region (Ausband et al. 2010). Trespass
that is short in duration and distance may also explain why
wolves in the Timberline pack did not prey on sheep during
summer 2010, despite their rendezvous site being <1.6 km from
a band of 2400 sheep. This pack has been implicated in multiple
depredations in one of the exclusion areas in previous years;
however, none was reported in this area in Summer 2010 or
Summer 2011. These results are unexpected, given the level of
trespass we observed in Timberline in 2011; trespassing took
place, but depredations did not. We readily acknowledge the
role that sheep herders may have played in averting wolf
depredations in 2010 and 2011, although herders were
ineffective in previous years when their presence did not deter
depredations on both sheep and guard dogs by this pack. The
Archie Mountain pack did not trespass the biofence in 2011;
however, this pack failed to successfully breed in 2011 and may
be disbanding, making interpretation of their response to the
biofence difficult (D. Ausband, unpubl. data). Two satellite
collars in this pack failed to obtain locations on a regular
basis, so knowledge of their movements is limited.

One potential explanation for the disparity in biofence
effectiveness between years may be that we did not deploy
biofences year-round and maintain the perception of a
continuous presence of the adjacent pack. Additionally,

because of the difficulties in obtaining sufficient numbers of
scats from the wild for use in biofence deployment, we were
unable to control for whether a pack consistently encountered
(via scent) the same individuals when visiting our biofences. If
resident packs detected discontinuity in the presence of
established, adjacent wolves (i.e. the biofence), they could
have been less averse to crossing the biofence in 2011 than
they were in 2010. Any further research on biofencing should
attempt to maintain the biofence over a longer timeframe, while
controlling for pack affiliation (or individual if possible) of the
scats used during biofence and maintenance. Last, wolves may
have showed less aversion to the biofence over time because
there were no visual or auditory cues indicating the presence of
another pack in the immediate area of the biofence.

The social status of a wolf affects its response to foreign scent
marks (Rothman andMech 1979); however, with four dominant-
status wolves (6 wolf-years) radio-collared, we did not detect a
strong trend between trespass and social status. Additionally, we
would expect the dominance of the individual whose scent mark
was deployed on the biofence to have an effect on biofence
efficacy. Seasonality and associated pheromone levels in scats
and urine also play a role in how canids respond to foreign scent
marks. Controlling for these factors is, of course, difficult in a
field-based study using wild wolf scats. Exploring the
effectiveness of using more easily obtainable, and selectable,
scats from captive wolves would be worthwhile.

Wolves travel roads and established trails and the deployment
andmaintenance of the primary line of the biofences required less
time and effort than the secondary line which was generally off-
trail.Wolves, however, seldom overmarked the secondary line of
the biofence and one line may be sufficient, thereby greatly
decreasing biofence deployment and refreshment time. Given
that trespass between adjacent wolf packs is expected and
common (Mech and Boitani 2003), we suggest placing
biofences between 2 and 3 km from an attempted exclusion
area. On the basis of the average trespass distances observed,
we believe this would be a suitable distance when using
biofencing to create an adequate buffer between resident
wolves and the attempted exclusion area.

We have limited inference to other canids, although similar
experiments with this technique have shown promise in African
wild dogs (Lycaon pictus; Jackson et al. 2012). Shivik et al.
(2011) recently found that biofencing using only urine was
ineffective for manipulating the movements of three coyotes,
whereas Arnold et al. (2011) found that the use of territory by
red fox (Vulpes vulpes) decreased in females and increased in
males following deployment of conspecific urine. We do not
know why biofencing would be ineffective for coyotes and
equivocal for red foxes, although the addition of scats and
scratch marks may have made it more effective as a deterrent
to movement, had they been used. Smaller canids may respond
more strongly to biofences if they are constructed with scent
marks of larger, dominant species (e.g. wolves). Indeed, some
studies have indicated that urine and scat from dominant
species can manipulate the movements of other species,
although results have been mixed (Paquet 1991; Scheinin
et al. 2006). A major goal when deploying a biofence is to
have the target species visit, investigate and respond in a
directional manner to the scent marks; therefore, any future
work should continue to focus on the animal’s response after
encountering the scent mark and not just whether the animal
investigated the urine or scat deposit.

Our sample size (n= 3 packs) and limited study design (i.e.
no controls) limit generalisation, and further evaluation of
biofencing is needed to determine its efficacy for deterring
depredations by wolves and other canids. Furthermore,
surrounding natural prey density may confound the
effectiveness of biofencing near livestock. A study that
samples many animals per pack and employs a treatment and
control design would be beneficial, albeit expensive and
logistically difficult. Additionally, testing the efficacy of
biofencing in core portions of an animal’s territory or near
livestock producers that have experienced persistent
depredation events would be useful. More frequent refreshing,
an adequate buffer distance (range 2–3 km) from the area to be
excluded, and the use of automated howling devices (Ausband
et al. 2011) may fortify biofencing (Harrington and Mech 1979)
and increase its effectiveness. Our work suggests, however, that
biofencing may be most limited by the apparent necessity to
maintain a continuous presence once the biofence is established.
The inherent labour and costs associated with such efforts may
limit the usefulness of biofencing.
