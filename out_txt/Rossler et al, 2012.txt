ABSTRACT Reduction of livestock losses from predators is a complex problem that requires the integration
of lethal and nonlethal management tools. During 2005 and 2006, we tested shock collars for conditioning
wild wolves (Canis lupus) in Wisconsin, USA, to avoid bait sites over an 80-day period. Treatment wolves
(n ¼ 10) visited shock zones less and spent less time at shock zones compared to control wolves (n ¼ 4)
during 40-day shock periods and 40-day post-shock periods. Treatment wolves remained away from shock
zones for a greater number of days compared to control wolves. A smaller proportion of treatment pack
members visited shock zones during shock and post-shock periods compared to control packs. Shock collars
conditioned treatment wolves to avoid bait sites for>40 days and reduced visitation by other pack members.
We also demonstrated the application of shock collars at the scale of livestock farms. Shock collars could serve
as a useful nonlethal tool for managing livestock depredations, particularly in chronic problem areas and with
endangered populations. � 2012 The Wildlife Society.

KEY WORDS behavior, Canis lupus, depredation, gray wolf, human–wildlife conflict, nonlethal management, shock
collars, site-aversive conditioning.

Gray wolf (Canis lupus) populations have rebounded in the
Upper Great Lakes region of the United States (Refsnider
2009). Greater numbers of wolves on the landscape can lead
to an increase in the number of livestock depredations (Mech
1995). Increased levels of depredations and development of
chronic depredation areas (i.e., farms that suffer livestock
depredations for �3 consecutive year) will lead to greater
animosity toward wolves, greater economic losses, and in-
creased compensation payments made by state governments
(Fritts et al. 1992, Mech et al. 2000, Treves et al. 2002).
Thus, effective resolution of livestock depredations is neces-
sary to ensure maintenance of recovered wolf populations and
recovery of wolves in additional areas of their historic range.
Wolf managers in the United States primarily use lethal

control as a management tool for minimizing conflict be-
tween wolves and human economic interests (Mech 1995).
Lethal control is a valuable tool for managing wolf–human
conflict (Berryman 1972, Archibald et al. 1991, Mech et al.

2000, Harper et al. 2008); however, it typically only reduces
depredation for �1 yr (Fritts et al. 1992, Shivik et al. 2003,
Bradley et al. 2005, Ruid et al. 2009) and may not reduce
depredations at a regional scale (Musiani et al. 2005).
Integrating lethal and nonlethal management tools would
likely further reduce livestock depredations (Gehring et al.
2006, Hawley et al. 2009). Nonlethal management tools are
generally more acceptable to the general public compared to
lethal control (Reynolds and Tapper 1996, Reiter et al.
1999). Nonlethal management tools also may be the only
option available for endangered wolf populations. However,
few nonlethal tools have been rigorously tested on free-
ranging wolves (Gehring et al. 2006, Hawley et al. 2009,
Davidson-Nelson and Gehring 2010, Gehring et al.
2010a,b).
Shock collars may be a useful nonlethal management tool

for depredation management (Andelt et al. 1999, Schultz
et al. 2005, Hawley et al. 2009). Andelt et al. (1999) found
that shock collars prevented captive coyotes (C. latrans) from
attacking sheep for >4 months after corrective shocks were
given. Shivik et al. (2003) found no evidence that long-term
conditioning occurred in trials with captive wolves. Schultz
et al. (2005) found shock collars prevented free-ranging
wolves in one pack from visiting a study farm, and had no
effect on the size of home range or maintenance of rendez-
vous site behaviors. Hawley et al. (2009) used an experimen-
tal design to test shock collars on wild wolves. They found
that shock collars restricted wolf access to specific sites but

did not lead to site-aversive conditioning. Our objectives
were to 1) determine the ability of shock collars to reduce use
of a specific site and lead to site-aversive conditioning, 2)
determine whether avoidance behavior of a site was trans-
ferred to uncollared pack members, and 3) apply shock-collar
technology to livestock farms in a depredation management
scenario.

STUDY AREA

Our study area was located in northwestern Wisconsin,
USA, including Ashland, Bayfield, Douglas, Sawyer, and
Washburn counties. A majority of the land was publicly
accessible and under county, state, federal, or commercial
paper company ownership. The study area was comprised
of 4 distinct ecological landscapes, as classified by the
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR),
including northwest lowlands, Superior coastal plains,
northwest sands, and north-central forest (WDNR 2000).
Agricultural land use did not add significantly to the econo-
my of the 5-county region; however, farm operations that
raised cattle, sheep, horses, and hay were dispersed
across the landscape and comprised a small percentage of
overall land cover (WDNR 2000). Approximately 33 wolf
packs were located within the study area. Human density
averaged between 7 persons/km2 and 12 persons/km2, con-
siderably less than the statewide average of 37 persons/km2

(WDNR 2000). A more detailed study area description was
provided by Rossler (2007).

METHODS

We usedWDNR track surveys and conducted our own track
and scat surveys along roads and trails within our study
area to identify potential study packs. Study packs contained
�3 adult wolves. We randomly assigned each pack to treat-
ment or control, but we prioritized gaining a greater
sample of treatment packs. During 15 May–15 June 2005
and 2006, we captured one wolf from each pack using
modified, Newhouse number 14 foot-hold traps (Kuehn
et al. 1986). We chemically immobilized wolves using an
intramuscular injection of 10 mg/kg ketamine hydrochloride
and 2 mg/kg xylazine hydrochloride (Wydeven et al. 1995).
We targeted adult wolves of either sex. We used tooth
eruption patterns, tooth wear, and animal weight to estimate
age and social status of captured wolves (Van Ballenberghe
and Mech 1975, Gipson et al. 2000). Lactating female,
diseased, and/or injured wolves were not included in our
study. We fitted treatment wolves with a modified shock
collar with an 80-day battery life (Rossler 2007). Shock
collars included a 400-g radiocollar (Telonics, Inc., Mesa,
AZ), to which we attached an Innotek (Invisible Fence
Technologies, Garrett, IN) shock unit (Rossler 2007,
Hawley et al. 2009). The total weight of the shock collar
did not exceed 4% of body mass of wolves (Kenward 2001). A
section of hair (10 cm � 10 cm) was shaved on the back of
the neck of treatment wolves to ensure contact between the
skin and probes of the shock collar (Andelt et al. 1999,
Rossler 2007, Hawley et al. 2009). We fitted control wolves
with only a radiocollar. Our research was approved by the

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Central
Michigan University (IACUC no. 13-04).

Site-Aversive Conditioning to Bait Sites
We established an area known as a bait site within the
territory of each study pack. Bait sites were created
>1.6 km from where a wolf had been trapped to ensure
no aversive conditioning due to trapping and handling near
the capture site (Hawley et al. 2009). We located bait sites at
the center of a primitive forest road intersection to allow
wolves to associate with particular spatial features of the
specific site. Similar criteria for bait sites were used to reduce
variation between sites, thereby controlling for any con-
founding factors. We placed one road-killed deer (with
minimal decomposition or destruction) at the center of
each bait site every 3 days during the 80-day experiment.
During each visit to the bait site, we noted whether the deer
was consumed before placing a fresh carcass. At each site we
defined a shock zone (circular area; Hawley et al. 2009)
extending 70 m from the center of the bait site (Fig. 1).
We placed radio data-loggers (HABIT Research Ltd.,
Victoria, BC, Canada) at the center of the bait site to
determine the frequency of visitation by wolves and time
spent by wolves in the shock zone. We programmed data-
loggers to scan for the very high frequency (VHF) of the
collared wolf in a study pack, and we included a dummy
frequency to ensure that wolf locations (48–51 pulses/min)
were legitimate (Hawley et al. 2009). Data-loggers recorded
percent signal strength of radiocollars and date and time that
wolves spent in the area.We calibrated data-loggers to record
signal strength as a function of distance from the center of
bait sites (Hawley et al. 2009). Signal strength of 60–100%
identified a wolf in the shock zone.
We placed shock towers (Schultz et al. 2005, Hawley et al.

2009) at the center of bait sites (adjacent to data-loggers) in
control and treatment packs. A reed switch timer, controlling
the shock tower, was placed on a 1-min setting, which

collars on gray wolves in northern Wisconsin, USA, May–September 2005
and 2006. The shock zone extended 70 m from the center bait site and track
swaths were located 35 m from the center.

signaled the shock tower to emit a low-frequency impulse
for 12-s intervals with a 48-s delay prior to the next
impulse. Remote triggering of the shock tower allowed shock
treatments to be administered to treatment wolves when
researchers were not present at the bait site (Schultz et al.
2005, Hawley et al. 2009). We adjusted the shock-tower
antenna to create a 70-m shocking radius around the bait site.
No wolves received a shock when they were located outside
the shock zone. Control wolves did not receive a shock collar,
but data-loggers monitored their use of bait site zones,
identical to treatment wolves.
We established track swaths on the primitive roads

approaching each bait site by clearing all vegetation and
large debris in 5-m-long strips as wide as the forest road.
Removal of debris and vegetation created loose dirt where
wolf tracks could be distinguished. We placed track swaths
on the primitive roads to utilize wolf behavioral tendencies of
traveling along paths of least resistance (Mech 1970,
Gehring 1995). Track swaths were placed 35 m from center
of bait sites and monitored every 3 days, concurrent with
baiting the sites (Fig. 1). A single set of tracks entering the
site was considered a single visitation. Tracks exiting the site
were not recorded to prevent double-counting. Once data
were collected, we raked track swaths to remove previous
tracks. We used track swaths to record collared and uncol-
lared wolf use of bait sites for treatment and control packs
(i.e., proportion of wolf pack visiting bait sites). Wolves may
travel as a pack in single-file lines (i.e., walking within each
other’s tracks;Mech 1970); therefore, our track-swath counts
may have underestimated the number of wolves visiting bait
sites. However, we assumed this potential bias would be
consistent across control and treatment packs.
Radiocollared wolves visited bait sites at least once within

2–4 days of capture (Rossler 2007, Hawley et al. 2009). On
the 5th day, post-capture, we began experimentation. Our
experimental design included recording treatment and con-
trol wolf movements over 1) a 40-day shock period during
which we shocked treatment wolves when they entered the
shock zone, and 2) a 40-day post-shock period during
which no wolves were shocked. This design simulated a
depredation management scenario whereby shock-collar
technology would immediately be implemented on a farm.
The 40-day post-shock period was used to determine wheth-
er site-aversive conditioning of the bait sites occurred in
treatment packs. We monitored treatment and control packs
concurrently throughout the field season in order to decrease
experimental bias due to time.
After the 80-day study period, we downloaded data from the

data-loggers to a laptop computer using a HABIT Research
Ltd. program. We chronologically sorted wolf visitation data
from static recordings (pulse rate >1,000 pulses/min) and
dummy frequencies (Hawley et al. 2009) using Excel
(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Data-loggers pro-
vided information for treatment and control wolves on 1)
amount of time spent in the shock zone, 2) number of visits
to the shock zone, and 3) number of days between shock zone
visits. We standardized the time spent in the shock zone as
mean number of minutes per day spent in the shock zone

during the shock and post-shock periods. We counted a
visitation to the shock zone when a wolf remained in this
zone for �48 s because of the delay mechanism (48 s) in our
shock-tower timer system. As such, a treatment wolf would
need to be in the shock zone �48 s to receive a shock. We
summed visitations to the shock zone and standardized them
as number of visits per day for shock and post-shock periods.
To determine site-aversive conditioning, we recorded the
number of days between the last visitation to the shock
zone during the shock period and the first visitation to the
shock zone during the post-shock period for treatment and
control packs.
For each check of track swaths, we summed wolf visits and

divided total number of visits by estimated wolf pack size,
which yielded number of visits proportional to pack size.
Wolf pack size was estimated using track evidence from
routine scouting of packs and howling surveys conducted
at the completion of experimental testing. We conducted
howling surveys at the end of experimentation so as to not
bias wolf movements. We summed visitation data at track
swaths for shock and post-shock periods, respectively. We
divided wolf visits for each study period by the number of
days track swaths were operational. We excluded days when
rain interfered with our ability to accurately record wolf
tracks. Standardized wolf visits at track swaths were recorded
as number of visits in proportion to pack size per track-swath
day.
Treatment and control wolves were located daily using

vehicle-mounted ground telemetry. Our vehicle-mounted
telemetry system consisted of a 5-element Yagi antenna,
electronic compass, and compass rosette to gain accurate
locations (Lovallo et al. 1994). We estimated locations
with �3 bearings and triangulation using Locate 3 (V. O.
Nams, Truro, NS, Canada). We used the maximum likeli-
hood estimator to generate error polygons for each location.
We used the 100% minimum convex polygon (MCP) meth-
od to estimate home-range size of treatment and control
wolves over the 80-day study period (Powell 2000). We used
ABODE (P. N. Laver, Blacksburg, VA) within ArcGIS and
Excel to conduct asymptotic analysis to determine the num-
ber of radio locations required to reach a stable home-range
size (Harris et al. 1990). We used the MCP estimator for
comparison to home-range size of Wisconsin wolves not
included in our study (Wydeven et al. 2004). We used the
Point Distance Tool within ArcToolbox to calculate the
linear distance each telemetry point (for treatment and con-
trol wolves) was from the bait site during the shock and post-
shock periods. We standardized the distance of locations
from the bait site by dividing by the home-range size for each
study pack.
We used the Shapiro–Wilk test within SAS (SAS Institute

Inc., Cary, NC) to determine whether data were normally
distributed.We log-transformed data that were not normally
distributed and checked again for normality. All data ana-
lyzed met assumptions for normality and equal variance after
transformation. We used Minitab 14 (Minitab Inc., State
College, PA) and a paired t-test (Zar 1996) to compare shock
period and post-shock period data for treatment and control

178 Wildlife Society Bulletin � 36(1)



wolves, respectively. We used a 2-sample t-test (Zar 1996) to
compare treatment and control packs during the shock and
post-shock periods, respectively. We used a significance level
of a ¼ 0.05. All results presented in figures represent non-
transformed data for ease of interpretation.
We accounted for cost of use of shock collars in this

research so that managers would have these data available
for depredation management decisions. We quantified costs
into 4 categories: 1) trapping wolves, 2) shock collars, 3)
shock towers, and 4) labor for monitoring shock systems. We
used WDNR estimates to calculate costs for trapping wolves
by combining fuel, equipment, and labor expenses. The cost
of shock collars included the shock unit and VHF radiocollar
developed by Rossler (2007). We included costs of shock
transmitters, batteries, and miscellaneous equipment for
construction of shock towers. We estimated labor for moni-
toring shock systems as monthly cost for one graduate re-
search assistant (stipend and fringe benefits) involved in this
study.

Site-Aversive Conditioning to Livestock Farms
During the study, we obtained permission to test shock
systems on 2 farms that experienced wolf depredation in
2004. The farms, designated as Farm A and Farm B, allowed
us to place data-loggers and shock towers in the center of
livestock pastures. We placed data-loggers on fence posts to
elevate them 2–3 m off the ground in order to protect them
from livestock damage and to maximize the range (800 m) of
detection for radiocollared wolves.We used a 45-cm antenna
on the shock transmitter to create a 0.8-km-radius shock
zone around the shock tower. This distance was adequate to
cover all pastures on each of the farms and create a 0.3-km
shock-zone buffer on all sides of the pasture, outside the
livestock fencing. We walked throughout livestock pastures
and the perimeter of each farm with a test shock collar to
ensure the shock transmitter and data-logger were commu-
nicating with the shock collar. Shock towers were monitored
and remained active during 7 June–23 August 2005. Data-
loggers remained active on the farms during 7 June–8
October 2005, to determine visitation to the farm after shock
collars were no longer functional. Shock-collared wolf visi-

tation to farms was determined using data downloaded from
the data-loggers and recorded as number of visits per day.

RESULTS

During 2005 and 2006, we monitored 10 treatment (8 M, 2
F; Table 1) and 4 control wolves (2 M, 2 F; Table 1).
One control wolf (W444) was previously trapped and
radiocollared by the WDNR. However, during trapping
attempts in 2005, she was captured and later pulled out of
the trap before immobilization. We considered her to have
been retrapped even though she was not immobilized
and processed. A female wolf, previously collared by the
WDNR in 2005 and not used in previous research, was
also used as a control in 2006. We collected 466 ground
telemetry locations on treatment wolves (x ¼ 22 locations=
wolf during shock period and x ¼ 23 locations=wolf during
post-shock period). We collected 144 locations on control
wolves (x ¼ 23 locations=wolf during both shock and post-
shock periods).

Site-Aversive Conditioning to Bait Sites
Treatment wolves spent an equal amount of time in the
shock zone during the shock period (x ¼ 1:1min=day,
SE ¼ 0.4) and post-shock period (x ¼ 1:3min=day, SE ¼
0.5; t ¼ �0.30, P ¼ 0.385). Control wolves spent less
time in the shock zone during the shock period (x ¼
13:6min=day, SE ¼ 3.0) compared to the post-shock period
(x ¼ 21:2min=day, SE ¼ 4.2; t ¼ �5.55, P ¼ 0.006).
Treatment wolves spent less time in the shock zone
during the shock (t ¼ �4.26, P ¼ 0.001) and post-shock
(t ¼ �5.78, P � 0.001) periods compared to control wolves
(Fig. 2a).
We found no difference in the number of visits treatment

wolves made to the shock zone during the shock period
(x ¼ 0:2 times=day, SE ¼ 0.06) and post-shock period
(x ¼ 0:2 times=day, SE ¼ 0.06; t ¼ 0.26, P ¼ 0.400).
Control wolves visited the shock zone less during the shock
period (x ¼ 0:9 times=day, SE ¼ 0.15) compared to the
post-shock period (x ¼ 1:4 times=day, SE ¼ 0.25;
t ¼ �2.55, P ¼ 0.042). Treatment wolves visited the shock
zone less than control wolves during the shock (t ¼ �4.26,

P ¼ 0.001) and post-shock (t ¼ �5.78, P � 0.001) periods
(Fig. 2b). We also found that a greater number of days
elapsed between visits to the shock zone for treatment
wolves (x ¼ 41:5days, SE ¼ 4.5) compared to control
wolves (x ¼ 5:8days, SE ¼ 2.6; t ¼ 4.83, P � 0.001).
We found no difference in the proportion of the wolf pack

visiting bait sites each day during the shock and post-shock
periods for treatment (t ¼ 1.30, P ¼ 0.112) and control
(t ¼ �1.96, P ¼ 0.072) packs. However, a smaller propor-
tion of treatment pack members visited the shock zone
during the shock period (t ¼ �3.53, P ¼ 0.002) and
post-shock period (t ¼ �9.70, P � 0.001) compared to

control packs (Fig. 2c). In 7 of 10 treatment packs, no
pack members visited bait sites once shocking occurred
during the shock period.
Home-range size was greater for treatment wolves

(x ¼ 82 km2, SE ¼ 10) compared to control wolves
(x ¼ 35 km2, SE ¼ 6) for the 80-day monitoring period
(t ¼ 2.91, P ¼ 0.013; Fig. 3). Treatment wolves were locat-
ed closer to bait sites during the shock period (x ¼ 3:5 km,
SE ¼ 0.5) compared to the post-shock period (x ¼ 4:5 km,
SE ¼ 0.4; t ¼ �2.03, P ¼ 0.037). We found no difference
in the distance control wolves were located from bait sites
between the shock and post-shock periods (t ¼ �0.14,
P ¼ 0.551). Treatment wolves were located farther from
bait sites during the shock period (t ¼ �2.46, P ¼ 0.030),
and the same distance during the post-shock monitoring
period (t ¼ �0.49, P ¼ 0.631) compared to control wolves.
Wolf trapping costs ranged from US$ 1,000–1,500/wolf

(A. P. Wydeven, unpublished data). Our shock-collar design
incorporating a modified Innotek shock unit (US$ 145/unit)
and Telonics radiocollar (US$ 280/unit) was an estimated
US$ 425/collar. We constructed shock towers at an estimat-
ed cost of US$ 300/tower. Graduate research assistant costs
were US$ 1,579/month. Total costs to trap and establish the
shock-collar system ranged from US$ 1,725 to US$ 2,225/
wolf, excluding labor costs for monitoring. Shock-collar
equipment cost (i.e., shock collar and shock tower) was
US$ 725/site.

Site-Aversive Conditioning to Livestock Farms
We recorded 2 visits on Farm A by a shock-collared wolf
during the shock period (4 Jul and 20 Aug 2005; Fig. 4). No
other visitations were recorded on Farm A during the moni-
toring period. We recorded zero visitations on Farm B.
However, U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service-Wildlife Services (USDA
APHIS-WS) confirmed a depredation of a pony foal on
Farm B on 12 August 2005. We suspect this was caused
by members of an adjacent pack. Farm B was located near the
eastern edge of the treatment pack and proximate to 3 known
neighboring wolf packs. U.S. Department of Agriculture

APHIS-WS trapped and euthanized 2 adult male wolves
within 0.8 km of Farm B. Neither of the 2 adult wolves
trapped by USDA APHIS-WS had been radiocollared or
fitted with a shock collar. Track evidence before the 2 adult
wolves were euthanized, and howling surveys conducted
afterward, indicated there were 4 adult wolves and 1–
3 pups in the treatment pack. We found no evidence that
the size of the treatment pack decreased after removal of the
2 adult males by USDA APHIS-WS. Of the 4 adult wolves
in the treatment pack, 2 were radiocollared adult males. The
presence of pups indicated �1 of the other 2 wolves to be a
female.

DISCUSSION

Shock collars appear to be effective in modifying foraging
behaviors and/or movements in captive coyotes (Linhart
et al. 1976, Andelt et al. 1999), captive wolves (Shivik
et al. 2003), island foxes (Urocyon littoralis; Cooper et al.
2005), and wild wolves (Schultz et al. 2005, Hawley et al.
2009; this study). Similar to Hawley et al. (2009), we found
that shock collars reduced the amount of time and the
number of visits by wolves to specific sites. We found a
12- to 16-fold reduction in amount of time at sites and 4-
to 7-fold reduction in visitation by shock-collared wolves
compared to control wolves. During active shocking, treat-
ment wolves also were displaced a greater distance away from
bait sites compared to control wolves.We found shock collars
aversively conditioned wolves to avoid bait sites for �1
month, whereas control wolves visited bait sites approxi-
mately weekly. Further, with only 1 member of a wolf
pack shock-collared, we reduced the use of bait sites by other
pack members compared to control packs. We also success-
fully used shock-collar systems on livestock farms as a dem-

onstration of a depredation management scenario similar to
Schultz et al. (2005).
Operant conditioning is applicable to our results. Operant

conditioning is characterized by a response to a stimulus
becoming more frequent if followed by positive con-
sequences but less frequent if followed by negative conse-
quences (Skinner 1981). Aversive conditioning is learning in
which a punishment or other unpleasant stimulation is used
to associate negative consequences with an undesirable re-
sponse, therefore reducing the frequency of that response.
Our design relied on a shock (negative consequence) received
by wolves when visiting the bait site (undesirable response).
Our design used free-operant avoidance learning, whereby
no discrete stimulus was used to signal a subsequent conse-
quence (Sidman 1953). Often psychological studies incor-
porate a signal stimulus with an unpleasant stimulus to
condition test animals to avoid undesirable responses
(Olton 1973). Schultz et al. (2005) relied on an auditory,
beeper system as a signal stimulus to aversive shock stimuli.
We relied on the specific site where the road-killed deer was
placed to act as the signal stimulus.
Many animals are capable of spatial learning and use cog-

nitive maps for travel and habitat use (Bell 1991). Wolves are
intelligent, territorial animals with the ability to learn readily
and retain what is learned for extended lengths of time
(Mech 1970). We suggest avoidance of bait sites by treat-
ment wolves was due to their ability to learn and associate the
negative stimulus (shock) with the location (signal stimulus)
in which the shock was administered. Denny et al. (1959)
found lab rats preferentially associated a shock with a given
location rather than with coextensive auditory stimuli. All
treatment wolves were shocked more than one time at the
same bait site, and bait sites remained consistent throughout
the entire 80-day study period. Biegler and Morris (1996)
found that consistency in environmental features increased
the potential for spatial learning. We suggest that reinforce-
ment of negative shock stimuli with the signal stimulus and
environmental features of the bait site allowed wolves to
associate the shock with the bait site and use cognitive
mapping and spatial learning to associate negative conse-
quences with the bait site. Treatment wolves likely associated
negative stimuli with bait site locations and not road-killed
deer placed at sites. Wolves were shocked when they
entered the shock zone surrounding bait sites, but not
shocked coincident with consuming deer. If wolves were
shocked instantaneously with consumption of deer, it is
likely aversive conditioning would occur to the deer bait.
For example, Andelt et al. (1999) conditioned coyotes to
avoid attacking sheep via shocking coyotes immediately
during their attempted attacks on sheep. Treatment wolves
remained within their home ranges and none died of starva-
tion throughout the course of the study or after the research
was completed.
Coppinger and Coppinger (2001) found most domestic

dogs would not learn to avoid a specific behavior after
only one correction. Shivik et al. (2003) noted high variabil-
ity in the response of captive wolves to corrective shocks,
which likely leads to the lack of aversive conditioning.

gray circle with lightning bolt in center. The shock tower was active through-
out this time period.

Rossler et al. � Shock Collars and Wolves 181



Hawley et al. (2009) suggested that variability in the pulsing
of shock in collars was a likely explanation for variation in
response of wolves to shock collars. Similar to Hawley et al.
(2009) we removed this technological variation in shock
collars via testing of individual collars. The short duration
of the shock trial (14 days) in the Hawley et al. (2009) study
likely reduced the probability of long-term aversive condi-
tioning. We used a 40-day shocking period to allow treat-
ment wolves to be shocked at least once, with time for
additional shocking treatments to reinforce the negative
stimulus upon return to bait sites. Our study suggests that
shock collars influenced behavior of wolves around bait sites
and wolves developed avoidance learning and aversion to
specific areas for >40 days after 40 days of shock treatment.
Control wolves, experiencing no shock stimulus, increased
time spent at and visitation rates to bait sites by 56%. Control
wolves had a positive association or conditioning (Bell 1991)
to bait sites (i.e., repeated positive, food stimulus with no
negative stimuli). Hawley et al. (2009) also found similar
results with control wolves, which increased visitation 18%
during trial periods.
No previous study has addressed questions dealing with

behavior of uncollared wolf-pack members in relation to a
wolf fitted with a shock collar. We found uncollared
wolves in treatment packs visited bait sites less than uncol-
lared wolves in control packs. Wolves are social animals
and there is continuous information transfer and communi-
cation between pack members related to social hierarchy—
dominance, temperament, injury, and hunting strategy
(Mech 1970). Information transfer between pack members
occurs directly via physical contact, eye contact, and body
postures (Mech 1970). Weingrill et al. (2005) suggested
direct visual contact during shocking was necessary for social
learning to occur in vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops).
Thus, if a treatment wolf entered a bait site and received a
shock, but no other members of the pack were with that wolf,
it is unlikely that information transfer would occur. Transfer
of information may occur later upon subsequent visits. Direct
transfer of information is more likely to occur when members
of a pack are together while visiting a specific site and a
shock-collared wolf receives a shock and then proceeds to
retreat from the site. Indirect communication is also an
important part of wolf social interaction, particularly during
denning and rendezvous periods when pack cohesion is
reduced (Mech 1970). Avoidance of bait sites could be
communicated through scent marking in the form of defe-
cation, urination, scratching, and/or gland secretion (Mech
and Boitani 2003). Other wolves visiting the site may
smell these secretions associated with distress and avoid
the site. However, washing away of scent or diminished
concentration over time may occur before other pack mem-
bers visit the site, thus prohibiting indirect communication.
The loss or decreased effectiveness of scent and lack of direct
communication may account for continued visitation by
some nonshock-collared pack members in 3 of 10 treatment
packs.
Although shock-collared wolves were displaced from spe-

cific locations within their home range, the size of their

summer home ranges was the same as summer home
ranges for Wisconsin wolf packs not included in our study
(Wydeven et al. 2004, WDNR 2006). Schultz et al. (2005)
found shock collars did not negatively impact movement
behavior, with regard to home range, of treatment wolves.
In our study, shock-collared wolves did not disperse outside
their home range after receiving a shock at bait sites. Home-
range size for control wolves was less than half the size of
summer home ranges for Wisconsin wolf packs not included
in our study (Wydeven et al. 2004,WDNR 2006). Localized
feeding of wolves (i.e., at bait sites) on a consistent schedule
was likely the reason for reduced home-range size. Control
wolves likely regarded bait sites as a regular source of food
resources, without a negative consequence. We also found
that control wolves shifted their movements and spent more
time proximal to bait sites. Hawley et al. (2009) suggested
the localized feeding of wolves, which were not subjected to a
negative stimulus, influenced the distribution of wolves upon
the landscape. Fritts et al. (1992) suggested that carcass
disposal sites (i.e., localized areas where dead livestock are
disposed by farmers) could increase wolf use of agricultural
areas. We suggest that localized feeding could be used as a
possible nonlethal depredation-management tool by divert-
ing wolf use away from livestock areas. Diversionary feeding
(as shown in our study) could constrict home-range size and
shift wolf movements away from livestock. Boertje et al.
(2010) demonstrated that diversionary feeding could reduce
predation on moose calves in Alaska, USA. Further research
should investigate the use of diversionary feeding as a non-
lethal management tool.
Schultz et al. (2005) and our tests on livestock farms

demonstrate the application of shock collars for depredation
management. However, our sample size was low and we
lacked control farms in this portion of our study to
gauge overall effectiveness of shock collars in a depreda-
tion-management scenario. An understanding of where his-
torical home-range boundaries are located is a major issue
that must be addressed before implementing shock collars.
Schultz et al. (2005) found shock collars can shift an indi-
vidual wolf away from an agricultural area. If a farm resides
on the boundary of 2 or more wolf packs, shifting the move-
ments of only 1 pack may leave the territory around the
farm vacant for other wolves to occupy. A nonshock-collared
pack shifting its territory to encompass the farm may con-
tinue with depredation behavior. We believe this may
have happened on 1 of our farms. Treves et al. (2002)
reported that 61% of all verified wolf depredations in
Wisconsin and 83% of verified wolf depredations in
Minnesota, USA, occurred during May–September. Our
current shock-collar design, with an 80-day battery life,
would provide 2.6 months of reduced visitation by a
shock-collared wolf to a farm. Based on our results, we
predict additional avoidance of farms by wolves after expira-
tion of the batteries via aversive conditioning. Thus, a sig-
nificant portion of the season when depredations occur
could be addressed with shock collars. Increasing shock-
collar battery life could extend the shocking period and
likely enhance aversive conditioning.

MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS

Shock collars could serve as an important management tool
in chronic depredation areas and/or where wolves are
endangered (e.g., southwestern United States). The use of
shock collars on farms experiencing chronic depredation
activity that is not alleviated through other control measures
is an appropriate wolf management consideration. Shock
collars may also be appropriate when wolf depredations occur
on isolated farms in the midst or edge of a large protected
area where lethal control is undesirable or prohibited. Future
research should examine long-term avoidance patterns of
wolves fitted with shock collars and the influence shock
collars have on pack dynamics and social learning.
