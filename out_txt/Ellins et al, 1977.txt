BRIEF REPORT 

Conditioned Taste Aversion" A Field Application 
to Coyote Predation on Sheep 1

Predation by free ranging coyotes (Canis latrans) on two sheep herds was 
inhibited by a procedure in which sheep carcasses laced with toxic lithium chloride 
were placed adjacent to the herds. When the lithium chloride bait was removed or 
replaced with nontoxic sodium chloride bait, bait takes and suppression of attacks 
on live prey continued. The blocking of attack behavior had not extinguished after 
9 weeks at the termination of the study. 

Despite massive attempts to control the coyote (Canis latrans) popula- 
tion in the United States in recent years, coyote densities are currently at 
their maximum, and their distribution is spreading across the North 
American continent (Fisher, 1975). Among the problems encountered as a 
result of this growing population is that incurred by sheep farmers who 
claim large losses of livestock due to coyote predation. 

Conditioned taste aversion has been shown to be effective in inhibiting 
the attack of captive coyotes on live prey after illness, induced by injec- 
tions of lithium chloride (LiC1) (Gustavson, Garcia, Hankins, and 
Rusiniak, 1974) or by eating LiC1-.treated bait (Gustavson, Kelly, 
Sweeny, and Garcia, 1976). A similar effect has been found with captive 
wolves and a cougar (Gustavson et al., 1976), ferrets (Rusiniak, Gustav- 
son, Hankins, and Garcia, 1976), and buteo hawks (Brett, Hankins, and 
Garcia, 1976). In the only field test of conditioned taste aversion in 
reducing coyote predation on sheep, Gustavson et al. (1976) reported a 
30-60% decrease in kills, relative to the records of the sheep farmer for 
prior years. However, these data remain controversial due to conflicts in 
reported kills between the researchers and the sheep farmer and the 
impracticality of using control procedures in that situation. The present

study was an additional attempt to test the effect of conditioned taste 
aversion in coyotes on the number of sheep killed under relatively con- 
trolled field conditions. Also, the effects of the continued presence or 
absence of toxic and nontoxic baits on the conditioned prey aversions 
were studied. 

The study was conducted in the Antelope Valley of the southern Califor- 
nia high desert. The valley is bordered on the north and south by the 
foothills of the Tehachapi and San Gabriel mountains, respectively, and is 
divided into east and west by a freeway and human population centers. It 
is sparsely populated, containing alfalfa, vegetable, and turkey farms and 
scattered vegetative cover comprised of creosote bush scrub and joshua 
tree woodland. Several lava buttes are found on the east side. The study 
took place in the fall and winter seasons during which the temperature 
remained mild and precipitation was minimal. The sheep were trucked 
into the study area from their summer grazing fields in the nearby 
mountains. 

The sheep herds under study were grazed on harvested alfalfa fields. 
Herd 1, which was on the east side of the valley, varied in size from 3000 
to 7000 sheep and lambs; and Herd 2, on the west side and approximately 
12.5 km from Herd 1, varied in size from 2000 to 2500 sheep and lambs. 
The variation in the sizes of the herds resulted from co~atinuous lambing 
throughout the study and occasional splitting of the herds as new grazing 
fields were occupied. Several bait stations containing dead adult sheep 
and lambs were located adjacent to each herd in areas frequented by 
coyotes. The bait was injected intramuscularly and intraperitoneally with 
a solution of 450 g of LiC1/11.36 liter of water or a nontoxic solution of 
225 g of NaC1/11.36 liter of water, depending on the experimental condi- 
tion. Both solutions were less concentrated than those found to be effec- 
tive and palatable in a previous study (Gustavson et al., 1976), and the 
concentration of the NaC1 was presumably strong enough to ensure a 
salty taste and, therefore, served as an effective placebo control. The 
stations were monitored two to three times per week for evidence of 
coyote tracks and bait takes, which were defined as all or part of a carcass 
being eaten or removed from the station. Evidence of coyote vomitus was 
also recorded, and baits were replaced as needed. Data on the location 
and number of sheep kills were obtained from the sheep herders two to 
three times per week, and kills were documented photographically. 
Coyote kills were determined by inspection of the sheep carcasses 
(Davenport, Browns, Workman, and Nielsen, 1973). Data collection was 
terminated when the herds left the study area for their summer pastures. 

Lithium chloride baiting for Herd 1 began on October 5, immediately 
after the herd was brought to its grazing area. Figure 1 indicates a 
substantial number of kills during the first 7 weeks of the study, followed 
by a reduction in kills which persisted through week 18. The number of

bait takes correlated positively with the number of kills until week I0, 
during which the LiC1 bait was removed and replaced with bait injected 
with the NaC1 solution. (The sheep herders had no knowledge of the 
initiation of the control conditions.) A high frequency of bait takes con- 
tinued throughout the study. 

Herd 2 experienced heavy losses due to coyote predation upon its 
arrival at its grazing area on December 5, and LiC1 baiting was initiated 
immediately. Figure 2 indicates a dramatic reduction in the number of 
kills following LiC1 baiting. The kill rate remained depressed for the 
remainder of the study, despite the fact that all bait was removed from the 
stations during week 5.

The results of the present study are consistent with those obtained with 
captive coyotes (Gustavson et  al., 1974; Gustavson et  al., 1976) and in the 
field (Gustavson et  al., 1976), where a conditioned aversion to the taste of 
bait associated with LiCl-induced illness generalized to other stimuli, as 
the sight, sound, and smell of living prey and, consequently, inhibited 
further attack. The initial decrease in kills associated with Herd  2 oc- 
curred approximately 1 month after the initial decrease in kills associated 
with Herd 1, supporting the notion that the decrease in both kill rates 
resulted from a conditioned aversion rather than from some extraneous 
factor that may have affected both herds. The large number of kills and 
bait takes prior to week 7 for Herd 1 may have been due to the geograph- 
ical location of this herd and its associated bait stations. The herd was 
separated into several bands which allowed the coyotes many access 
routes to the sheep. This may have increased the amount of time neces- 
sary for a significant proportion of the coyote population to locate the bait 
and become averted. By week 7, the coyotes ceased to identify sheep as 
palatable prey, and the rate of kills declined. The data in Fig. 1 also 
support a proposed two-phase conditioning process in predatory mam- 
mals (Garcia, Clark, and Hankins, 1973). In the first phase, conditioned 
taste aversion occurs, although the attacks on living prey elicited by 
visual olfactory, and auditory stimuli continue. This occurred through 
week 7, relative to Herd 1, in which the killing continued in spite of 
simultaneous consumption of the LiCl-laced bait. In the second phase, 
the same stimuli from the living prey becomes associated with the un- 
palatable taste, subsequently inhibiting attacks. This occurred from week 
7 to the termination of the study. 

It is likely that the extent to which extinction of a conditioned taste 
aversion occurs depends on the availability of an alternate food supply. 
Gustavson et  al. (1974) found that, with captive coyotes without an 
alternate food supply, extinction progressed gradually as the coyotes 
nibbled at dead prey and then waited for a short time to determine 
whether or not the food was "safe" ,  thus reacquiring a taste for the food. 
The continued bait takes after the aversion was acquired, shown in Fig. 1, 
indicate that "sampling and waiting" may have also been taking place in 
the present study. The fact that extinction of the attack response did not 
occur prior to the termination of this study, about 9 weeks following the 
presentation of nontoxic bait for Herd 1 and after 5 weeks following the 
removal of all bait for Herd 2, as contrasted with variable but shorter 
extinction intervals reported by Gustavson et  al. (1976), is due to the fact 
that our coyotes had an alternate source of food. When other food sources 
are made available to averted captive coyotes, extinction is greatly pro- 
longed (Gustavson et al., 1976). In their field study, these researchers 
found a deceleration in kills, bait takes, and coyote sightings, following 
aversion to the bait, then an acceleration in all three measures. It was

speculated that naive transient coyotes were likely to have entered their 
treatment range after the original population had been averted and had 
vacated the area. In contrast, based on geographical differences in the 
study areas, it is probable that the coyote population in the present study 
remains fairly stable. Observations by sheep herders indicate that the 
same coyotes have been seen around their herds over long periods of 
time. 

It is a common practice for sheep herders to discard their dead sheep in 
close proximity to their herds, therefore "setting a table" for roaming 
coyotes and ensuring that they acquire a taste for mutton which could 
ultimately result in increased predation. It is our contention that this 
harmful practice can easily be turned to the advantage of the sheep farmer 
by simply injecting the discarded carcasses with a solution of LiC1 and 
thus averting potential predators to the taste of sheep. It is evident that 
the taste aversion method is a useful tool in controlling coyote predation 
on domestic animals, and that, given the availability of alternate food 
sources in the field, the maintenance of the conditioned aversion requires 
LiCI baiting only at widely spaced intervals.
