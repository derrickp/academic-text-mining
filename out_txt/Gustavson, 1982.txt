Lithium 
chloride-laced 
cow-baits were placed on a ranch in prime wolf habitat 
in 
Northern Minnesota. Decreased bait consumption 
over the summer, and an experimental 
control 
for the effects of season, suggested that bait aversions were established in the wol 
f 
population. 
Since losses were historically 
low on the ranch, 
loss reduction 
may not have been an appropriate 
indicator of predation prevention. The dramatically 
decreased number of wolves taken from the ranch, compared 
to previous years, without 
a concurrent 
increase 
in depredation, 
suggests limited success.

INTRODUCTION 

(Canis 

Wolf 
lupus) predation 
on 
livestock 
presents 
a serious management 
problem 
in limited 
wolf habitats, 
and proposed 
recovery 
programs must 
evaluate 
and overcome 
the potential 
problem 
of stock 
damage 
before 
re- 
establishment 
of 
free-ranging 
wolf populations 
can be undertaken. 
Since 
traditional 
predator 
management 
techniques 
(killing 
or 
translocation) 
may 
be impossible, 
counter 
productive 
or undesirable 
in managing 
endangered 
species 
or animals 
in restricted 
habitats, 
alternative 
control 
procedures 
must 
be investigated. 
Taste 
aversion 
conditioning 
has been 
shown 
to alter 
the 
feeding 
behavior 
of many 
species 
in the 
laboratory, 
including 
wolves 
and coyotes 
(Canis 
Establishment 
of a taste 
aversion 
involves 
feeding 
an animal 
a dis- 
tinctive 
flavor 
followed 
by 
the 
induction 
of a non-lethal 
toxicosis 
(often 
using 
lithium 
chloride, 
LiCl). The 
theoretical 
and empirical 
basis of 
taste 
aversion 
conditioning 
for predator 
control 
has been 
described 
by Gustavson 
et al. (1974,1976,1979), 
Garcia 
et al. (1974) 
and Gustavson 
(1979). 
Field 
techniques 
for applications 
to coyotesheep

have been 
discussed 
by Gustavson 
et al. (1976,1982), 
Gustavson 
(1977,1979), 
and 
Ellins 
et al. (1977).

techniques. 
During 
the 
summer 
of 1979, 
field 
techniques 
developed 
for coyote 
con- 
trol were modified 
for application 
to a small cattle 
ranch within 
northern 
Minnesota’s 
prime wolf 
range. This 
ranch 
has a history 
of wolf damage, 
and 
seemed 
to provide 
an ideal opportunity 
for developmental 
evaluation 
of 
taste 
aversion 
conditioning 
for wolf predation 
control. 
Our purposes 
did not 
include 
an attempt 
to provide 
conclusive 
for, or against, 
the use of 
taste 
aversion 
control. 
The 
intent was 
to develop 
beef-flavored 
baits 
containing 
lithium 
chloride, 
(2) 
to document 
consumption 
and changes 
in consumption 
of 
by wolves 
in the 
field, 
(3) 
to develop 
a technique 
to establish 
beef 
aversion 
in trapped 
that were 
radio-collared 
and 
released 
back 
into 
the capture 
area, 
(4) 
to compare 
the number 
of cattle 
losses and wolf 
removals 
during 
the 
current 
year with 
losses and 
removals 
during 
previous 
years 
for preliminary 
assessment 
of 
the 
impact 
of 
taste 
aversion 
conditioning 
on 
the wolf-cattle 
interactions

the 
ranch.

METHODS 

The 

ranch 

The 
study 
ranch 
(approximately 
3.25 km’) was located 
approximately 
7.25 km northwest 
of Ash Lake on U.S. Highway 
53 
in St. Louis County, 
Minnesota 
(Township 
67: Range 
21: Sections 
13 and 24, and Range 
20: 
Sections 
18 and 19). Permission 
to use the 
ranch 
as a study 
area was granted 
by 
the 
owner, 
Julian Brzoznowski, 
before 
initiation 
of baiting 
on 22 May 
1979. However, 
permission 
was revoked 
on 28 June 
1979, 
for 
reasons 
not 
directly 
related 
to 
the 
taste 
aversion 
study. 
Baiting was resumed 
in areas 
immediately 
adjacent 
to 
the 
ranch 
on 6 July 
1979. 
In general, 
the 
ranch 
is heavily 
timbered. 
The area 
surrounding 
the 
is laced with 
logging 
roads 
and heavy 
logging has resulted 
in abundant 
browse. 
The area supports 
a viable deer 
population. 
Bears 
(Ursus americanus) 
are abundant. 
Coyotes 
and 
foxes 
(Vulpes 
uulpes) 
are also present. 

ranch 

Baits 

From 
22 May 1979 
to 
(approximately) 
20 June 
1979, 
baits consisted 
about 
227 g ground 
beef, 
laced with 
a solution 
of 4 g LiCl 
in tap water, 
wrapped 
in a piece 
of fresh 
cow-hide 
and 
tied with 
cotton 
twine 
(total 
weight 
approximately 
800 g). Ravens 
appeared 
to be consuming 
many 
of 
the baits. 
From 
18 June 
1979, 
baits were 
secured 
in plastic mesh netting 
and 
this material 
seemed 
to discourage 
the 
ravens. The ground 
beef 
content 
was increased 
to approximately 
454 g, and 
the LiCl content 
was increased 

of 

65 

field 

to 6.5 g from 
about 
20 June 
1979. These 
baits were maintained 
to 
the 
end of 
the 
study, 
which was 21 September 
1979. 
A total 
of 932 baits were placed 
on ranches 
during 
the 
study; 
728 beef 
baits 
at Brzoznowski’s 
ranch. 
Forty 
baits were placed 
in pastures 
at the 
Brzoznowski 
ranch, 
and 
the 
remaining 
688 baits were placed within 
an 
(aaproximately) 
8 -km 
radius 
of 
the 
ranch 
throughout 
the 
study 
period. 
Fifty 
beef 
baits were distributed 
at each of 2 ranches 
separated 
from 
the 
Brzoznowski 
ranch 
by 80 and 75 km, and 52 horse 
baits were distributed 
2 other 
ranches 
30 and 125 km 
from 
the Brzoznowski 
ranch.

Trapped wolf treatment 

Wolves were 
trapped 
on or near 
the Brzoznowski 
ranch 
for 
two 
reasons. 
(1) Traps were 
set following 
a verified 
cattle 
kill (according 
to U.S.F.W.S. 
regulations). 
One wolf 
trapped 
under 
these 
circumstances 
was destroyed. 
(2) Research 
trapping 
was conducted 
to 
radio-collar 
wolves 
in order 
to 
iden- 
tify 
home 
ranges 
and 
to 
record movement 
of both 
individuals 
and packs. 
Wolves captured 
for 
these 
research 
purposes 
were 
exposed 
to 
the 
following 
aversion 
treatment. 
The 
animal was anesthetized 
with “Ketaset”, 
“Sernylan” 
and/or 
“Sparine”. 
The 
radio 
collar was attached. 
Blood 
and urine 
samples 
were 
taken. 
Penicillin 
was administered. 
The 
animal’s mouth 
was “packed” 
with groun,d beef 
and hide. A 236-cc 
(4 g) i.p. 
injection 
of LiCl 
(18 g/l HzO) 
was administered 
at about 
the 
time 
the animal 
appeared 
to 
regain 
conscious- 
ness. Ringers 
lactate 
was administered 
to help prevent 
dehydration. 
This 
procedure 
was later modified. 
The LiCl was administered 
by 
intragastric 
intubation, 
and 
the Ringers was not 
administered.’ 

RESULTS 

AND DISCUSSION 

Wolf radio tracking 

Nine wolves were 
captured 
for 
radio 
tracking. 
One of 
these wolves 
in handling, 
and 
two died 
soon 
after 
release. 
The most 
distal 
relocation 
points were 
connected 
to estimate 
the possible 
ranges 
of 
the 
animals 
and 
areas were 
identified 
(Fig. 1): “a” 
(Arbutus 
road 
area); “s” (Sheep 
Ranch 
road 
area); “n” 
(Nine Mile Creek 
area); 
“al” 
(Ash Lake 
area). Animal

64 km

it remained 
until

* Since the completion 
of this field study, experiments with a captive male and female 
wolf suggest that aversions to canned dog food were not established using the anesthesia 
procedure, but plain dog food avoidance was demonstrated 
in the female following free 
consumption 
of LiCl “laced” dog food.

Bait 

removal 

All of 
the 
initial 
baiting 
(22 May 1979) 
was conducted 
in the areas out- 
lined by 
the 
range estimates 
(areas 
“a”, 
“s”, 
“n” 
and “al”, 
or the 
sum of 
these 
areas, 
“a + al”) 
for animals 
“a”, 
“s”, 
“n” 
and “al”, 
and 
the bait 
locations 
can be assigned 
to each of 
the areas. Baits were 
initially 
placed 
an area west of Ash Lake 
on 6 July 
1979. 
This 
area 
roughly 
corresponded 
to animal 
“z”, 
in Township 
66, Range 
21, 
Sections 
7-9 
and 16-21 
(area 
“Z”). 
A total 
of 97 baits were known 
to have been 
taken 
from 
the 
stations 
by 
wolves, 
79 by bears, 
and 83 by ravens. 
In addition, 
176 
baits were 
found 
to 
have been 
removed 
from 
the bait 
stations 
but no 
indication 
of 
the animal 
responsible 
could 
be 
found. 
These 
instances 
probably 
involved wolves 
and 
bears, 
but may have contained 
a disproportionate 
number 
of bird 
takes 
in 
grassy areas where 
tracks were difficult 
to 
find. No attempt 
was made 
to 
distribute 
these 
takes 
proportionately 
into 
other 
categories. 
Bait 
removal 
data were analyzed 
by each 
area 
independently, 
and by 
grouping 
areas “a”, 
“s”, 
“n”, 
and “al” 
(area 
a + al). Table

the weekly 
sum of 
the number 
of baits available 
for 24-h periods 
for each 
of 
the 18 study weeks 
in area “a + al”. The availability 
of baits was variable 
during 
the 
first part of 
the 
study, 
but 
stabilized 
as bait preparation 
tech- 
niques 
became 
routine. 
Column 
3, Table 
I, shows 
the 
same 
information 
for 
the general 
area “z”, which was baited 
only 
during 
the 
last 12 weeks 
of the 
study. Again, bait availability 
remained 
relatively 
constant. 
In Columns 
4 and 5, Table 
I, the number 
of 
takes 
by all species 
in areas 
“a + al” and “z” are 
listed 
for 
the weeks 
that 
baits were 
available 
in each 
area. 
Identified 
bait-takes 
by wolves 
are 
listed 
in Table 
I for area a + al 
(column 
6) and 
for area z (column 
7). Baits 
taken 
by animals 
other 
than 
wolves 
(including 
“unknown” 
takes) 
are 
listed 
in Table 
I, column 
8, for 
area a + al, and 
in column 
9 for area z. 
A problem 
with 
the 
interpretation 
of 
these 
results 
could 
arise because 
the use of “actual 
take” 
data when 
the number 
of baits available 
in the 
field varied 
not 
only 
on a weekly 
basis, but 
also day by day. Common 
sense 
might 
suggest 
that 
the more 
baits available 
in the 
field, 
the more 
likely 
it 
will be for an animal 
to encounter 
and possibly 
consume 
a bait. Therefore, 
since 
the availability 
of baits 
in the 
field varied, 
a more 
appropriate 
measure 
than “actual 
takes” might 
be the proportion 
of “actual 
takes”/available 
baits. 
The baiting 
procedure 
used 
in this study may be a special 
case 
in which 
this 
relationship 
does not hold 
for a specific 
species. The 
correlation 
between 
wolf 
takes 
and 
the baits available 
in the 
field 
(r = 0.36; 
df = 16; P > 0.10) 
is 
not 
significant, 
but 
a slight positive 
relationship 
is indicated. 
The 
relationship 
between 
“non-wolf” 
takes 
and available 
baits 
represents 
a significant 
correla- 
tion 
(r = 0.67; 
df = 16; P < 0.001). 
This correlation 
suggests 
a strong, 
posi- 
tive 
relationship 
between 
availability 
of baits 
and 
takes 
by animals 
other 
than wolves. 
The 
relationships 
represented 
in these 
correlations 
appear 
counter-intuitive, 
but 
let us examine 
the 
field procedure. 
The baits were placed 
by an experi- 
enced wolf-trapper 
with 
instructions 
to place 
the baits 
in areas “as though 
the baits were 
traps”. When “few” 
baits were available 
for placement, 
the 
locations 
selected 
as optimal 
for wolf activity 
by 
the 
trapper 
were main- 
tained. When “many” 
baits were available 
for placement, 
areas 
selected 
possible 
areas 
for wolf activity 
were also baited. 
The 
lack of a significant 
correlation 
between 
wolf 
takes 
and available 
baits 
suggests 
that 
for 
the most 
part during 
the 
study, 
the optimum 
bait 
locations 
for wolves were maintained. 
The 
significant 
correlation 
between 
non-wolf 
takes 
and available 
baits 
suggests 
that 
on some 
occasions 
high 
levels 
of bait-availability 
made 
baits more 
available 
to species 
other 
than wolves. 
This 
relationship 
further 
suggests 
that 
baits placed 
for wolves might 
be less 
than 
optimally 
placed 
for other 
animals. 
These 
data do not 
establish 
(1) what 
is an appropriate 
bait 
location 
for wolves, 
or (2) what might 
be an optimal 
level of baiting. 
These 
data 
suggest 
that 
“actual” 
rather 
than 
proportional 
data 
for wolf 
takes may be as appropriate 
for 
interpretation, 
if not more 

so. 

of 

as 

69 

This 
suggestion 
is further 
reinforced 
by 
the 
significant 
correlations 
(P < 0.001) 
between 
“actual 
takes” 
and “%I available 
takes” 
for both wolves 
and all 
species, 
(wolves: 
r = 0.64; 
total 
takes: 
r = 0.61). 
With 
the 
afore-mentioned 
problems 
in mind, 
the decreasing 
trends 
in bait 
takes 
represented 
in columns 
2-9, 
Table 
I, suggest 
that 
aversions 
were 
estab- 
lished 
to 
the beef-flavored 
baits, 
not 
only 
in wolves 
but 
in all of 
the 
species 
encountering 
the baits. 
One argument 
that might 
be raised with 
this 
interpretation 
is the possibili- 
ty 
that 
bait 
takes may have decreased 
only 
because 
of seasonal 
variables. 
However, 
the mean 
number 
of wolf 
takes was 0.75/ares 
in areas “a”, “al”, “s” 
and “n” during 
the 
sixth week 
of 
the 
study. 
The number 
of bait 
takes was 
4.0 
in area “z” during 
the 
same week 
(the 
first week 
that 
baits were avail- 
able 
in this area). 
We can opportunistically 
take 
advantage 
of 
this comparison 
as an experi- 
mental 
control 
for seasonal 
variables. 
This multiple 
baseline 
comparison 
sug- 
gests 
that 
bait consumption 
in the newly-baited 
area was higher 
than 
the area 
baited 
six weeks 
earlier. 
Thus, 
the decrease 
in bait consumption 
over 
time 
was probably 
not 
the 
result 
of seasonal 
changes 
in feeding. 

Cattle 

losses 

The ultimate 
purpose 
for 
the use of 
taste 
aversions 
in predator 
manage- 
ment 
is to 
reduce 
stock 
losses, not 
to establish 
aversions 
to baits. The design 
of 
this 
study 
does not 
allow 
conclusive 
evaluation 
of 
the 
impact 
of beef bait 
aversions 
on stock 
losses on 
the Brzoznowski 
ranch. An estimate 
of 
the 
im- 
pact 
can only 
be made 
by comparing 
current 
losses and wolf 
removal 
with 
historical 
records. 
J. Brzoznowski 
reported 
that 
in 1976, 
16 cattle were 
lost 
to wolves, 
while 
in 1977, 
2 were 
lost. Five were 
reported 
lost 
in 1978, 
and 7 were claim- 
ed lost 
in 1979. The Minnesota 
Department 
of Agriculture 
paid claims 
for 
5 losses 
in 1978, 
and 3 in 1979. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
initiated 
control 
trapping 
on only 
one occasion, 
in 1979, with 
the verified 
kill of a 
calf prior 
to 
the onset 
of 
the 
taste 
aversion 
baiting 
program. 
The 
source 
for 
the different 
levels of reported 
losses by 
the different 
agents 
is not 
the direct 
concern 
of 
this evaluation. 
Since only 
the 
rancher’s 
reports 
allow much 
in 
the way of historical 
loss records, 
they will be used 
for 
this evaluation 
with- 
out 
regard 
to any questions 
of validity. 
These 
records 
suggest 
that 
a relative- 
ly stable 
rate of 
losses has occurred 
from 
1977 
to 1979, which 
includes 
the 
experimental 
year 
for aversions. 
This 
information 
by 
itself 
suggests 
little 
support 
for a positive 
impact 
of aversion 
establishment 
on 
the 
ranch. 
However, 
in 1976, 
30 wolves were 
captured 
on 
the 
ranch. Of these 
30 
wolves, 
1 escaped, 
1 was shot 
illegally, 
2 died 
in handling 
and 26 were 
trans- 
located 
to other 
areas. A total 
of 29 wolves were 
removed 
from 
the 
ranch 
in 
1976. 
In 1977, 
31 wolves were 
captured, 
and 31 wolves were 
removed 
from 
the 
ranch 
by 
translocation. 
Seventeen 
wolves were 
captured 
in 1978. Ten 

were killed 
intentionally, 
5 were 
translocated, 
1 died 
in handling, 
and 1 was 
given 
to a zoo. All 17 were 
removed 
from 
the 
ranch. Wolf 
removal 
in 1979 
totaled 
4. One was intentionally 
killed, 
1 died 
in handling 
and 2 died 
follow- 
ing release. Also, 6 wolves were captured, 
collared 
and 
released 
back 
into 
the 
capture 
area. 
While a decrease 
in stock 
losses cannot 
be documented 
for 
the 
taste 
aver- 
sion program, 
84% 
fewer wolves were 
removed 
from 
the area during 
the 
taste 
aversion 
study 
year 
than 
the mean 
(25.07) 
number 
of wolves 
removed 
during 
the previous 
years. 
These 
results may 
represent 
the maximum 
expected 
benefit 
of such a 
program. Wolves 
as predators 
are capable 
of 
taking 
domestic 
stock 
including 
cattle, 
and any program 
of control 
is not 
likely 
to prevent 
all predation. 
Since 
losses on 
the 
ranch 
in 1977 
and 1978 were 
relatively 
low 
(numerical- 
ly, not necessarily 
in an economic 
sense), 
further 
reduction 
in losses might 
not be expected. 
However, 
if the goal of a management 
program 
is to 
reduce 
domestic 
stock 
losses 
to a minimum 
and at the 
same 
time 
allow 
a viable 
un- 
harassed 
predator 
population 
to co-exist 
in stock 
areas, 
then 
the 
results 
of 
this study 
are consistent 
with 
the 
suggestion 
that 
the 
taste 
aversion 
program 
as applied 
to 
the Brzoznowski 
ranch was successful.
