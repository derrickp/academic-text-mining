142 GRAY WOLF AVERSIVE CONDITIONING

CCaarrnniivvoorreess  aanndd  OOmmnniivvoorreess

Gray wolf (Canis lupus) populations recolonized
the state of Wisconsin in the mid-1970s, and by
2003 over 335 wolves occurred in the state
(Wydeven and Wiedenhoeft 2003). With the wolf
population increase, depredation on domestic ani-
mals also increased (Treves et al. 2002). Because
wolves were listed as a federally endangered
species until April 2003, the state had little authori-
ty for killing problem wolves. Although adult
wolves could be translocated, females with young
pups at den sites posed special problems.

Flashing lights and sirens (Fritts et al. 1992), taste
aversion (Gustavson 1982, Jelinski et al. 1983), elec-
tronic howling devices, artificial scent marking
(Schultz et al. 1999), and trained domestic animals
(Fritts et al. 1992) have been used to deter wolves
from killing livestock. Electronic dog-training col-

lars have been tested on captive coyotes (C.
latrans) as a way to prevent them from killing
domestic lambs (Andelt et al. 1999), and 3 of 4 coy-
otes were conditioned to avoid black domestic rab-
bits and prey on white rabbits with a prototype
electronic collar (Linhart et al. 1976). However, we
are unaware of any references or studies demon-
strating the use of dog-training shock collars on
free-ranging wild gray wolves to prevent livestock
depredation. We evaluated the use of a dog-training
shock collar fitted to wild, free-ranging gray wolves
to prevent livestock depredation.

Experimental use of dog-training shock
collars to deter depredation by gray wolves

Ronald N. Schultz, Kenneth W. Jonas, Lesa H. Skuldt, 
and Adrian P. Wydeven

Abstract We examined the use of dog shock collars on 2 different wolves (Canis lupus) over a 4-year
period to assess whether this system could be used to reduce wolf depredation on livestock.
In 1998 we used human-induced shock and determined that the shock collar could keep a
depredating wolf off a farm while maintaining normal den- and rendezvous-site attendance,
but it did not seem to have a long-term effect on the wolf’s behavior.  In 1999 we captured
a wolf prior to any depredations and used a command center with a beeper that remotely
shocked the wolf while also providing aversive stimuli; no depredations occurred in 1999.
We used the beeper unit alone in 2000, when only 2 calves were killed.  A second wolf
was captured in 2001 after depredations began, and although it was kept off the farm, other
pack members caused further depredation and were removed from the farm.  It appears that
in some situations shock collars with a command center and beeper device may be useful
for reducing wolf depredations, but more research is needed.

losses had occurred since 1995. Approximately
300–560 calves were born on the farm each year
during April–May in outside pastures. Calves were
rotated among 2–3 fenced pastures during the
course of the summer. Cattle were contained with
a 4–6-strand 1.4-m-tall barbed wire fence with an
additional 1 strand of electric wire in the center.

The farm included mixtures of oak–pine–aspen
(Quercus–Pinus–Populus spp.) forest, brushy
grasslands, and open pastures dominated by cool-
season grasses. Lowlands adjacent to a small (5-m-
wide) stream comprised
about 10% of the farm.
County forest lands, used
extensively by wolves
since the early 1990s
(Kohn et al. 2000), sur-
rounded much of the farm
to the west, north, and
south. A pair of wolves
established a territory
(Chase Brook Pack) near
the farm during the winter
of 1994–1995. During the
study period, the pack
occupied a 156-km2 terri-
tory encompassing the
farm (Figure 1 [minimum
convex polygon based on
246 radiolocations of 2
adult female wolves from
April 1998–September
2001]). We assumed this
pack was responsible for
the majority of wolf depre-
dation on the farm from
1998–2001.

White-tailed deer (Odo-
coileus virginianus) densi-
ties in the area ranged from
12–16 per km2 (Wisconsin
Department of Natural
Resources, unpublished
data). Other wolf prey
species included snowshoe
hare (Lepus americanus),
beaver (Castor canaden-
sis), and cottontail rabbit
(Sylvilagus floridanus).
Black bears (Ursus ameri-
canus) and coyotes oc-
curred frequently on the

farm, but neither was determined to be responsible
for any livestock losses.

Methods
Wolves have been live-trapped and tracked with

radiotelemetry since 1979 in Wisconsin (Wydeven
et al. 1995). We captured wolves in number 4 and
number 14 foot-hold traps (Kuehn et al 1986), tran-
quilized them with 5:1 ratios of ketamine HCl and
xylazine HCl, and reversed with yohimbine. All ani-

mals in this study were handled in a humane man-
ner in accordance with Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources (DNR), Animal Care and Use
Committee guidelines. We normally located radio-
collared wolves once or twice per week by air-
planes. Wolf depredations on the farm were veri-
fied by United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) technicians using field sign (Acorn and
Dorrance 1990).

On 28 May 1997 an adult female wolf (724F) was
captured and radiocollared as part of another
research project (Kohn et al. 2000). She was lactat-
ing at the time and was assumed to be the alpha
female of the Chase Brook Pack. We located wolf
724F from the air 1–3 times per week to determine
location, territory area (minimum convex polygon),
and size of the pack (Mohr 1949, Fuller and Snow
1988).

We began data collection on 14 May 1998 when
wolf 724F was recaptured on the farm after 2 calf
depredations had occurred. At that time we fitted
her with an electronic dog-training shock collar
(INNOTEK Pet Products, Inc. Garrett, Ind.) in addi-
tion to her transmitter collar. The shock collar was
assumed to have a battery life of about 2 months.
We located wolf 724F day and night in 8-hour seg-
ments, 5–7 days per week, by radiotelemetry from
the ground (triangulation) as often as possible. We
gave the wolf an electrical shock via a hand-held
sending unit every time her location indicated trav-
el within 300 m of the cattle pasture. We deter-
mined locations 30, 60, and 120 minutes following
each shock. We compared distances moved
between intervals to distances moved at similar
intervals during normal (nonshock) activities. The
percentage of locations at her known den site at 60-
and 120-minute intervals following each shock
were compared to locations obtained >24 hours
after she had been shocked. We used independent
2-sample T-test, chi-square and Spearman rank cor-
relation tests to compare normal and post-shock
movements and locations.

On 26 April 1999 we recaptured wolf 724F off
the farm, prior to any depredations on calves, and
fitted her with a new shock collar. She was again
lactating. We used a shock command center to
automatically emit a beep and trigger the shock
when 724F came within 0.4 km of the command
center. This eliminated the need for intensive mon-
itoring and ensured that wolf 724F would be given
a shock every time she approached the calves.

The command center consisted of 1) a deep-

cycle, 12-volt marine battery, 2) a voltage reducer
(12 to 9 volts), 3) an INNOTEK dog shock collar
sending unit with antenna (INNOTEK Pet Products,
Inc, .Garrett, Ind.), 4) 1.5-volt clock runner with
magnetic reed switch attached to the second hand,
5) clock mounting plate with 2 magnetic reed
switches, and 6) Pirzo beeper 275-075, 6-28VDC,
25MA. MAX, (Radio Shack, Minocqua, Wisc.). We
mounted these items in a 50.8 × 50.8 × 30.5-cm
weatherproof camouflaged wooden box (Figure 2).

We set the command center to emit a shock sig-
nal to the collar 2–3 seconds of every minute. We
set the signal range to cover the pasture where
most calving occurred (0.5 km2). The beeper unit
would emit a beep for 2–3 seconds immediately
before the shock command was sent. We could
hear the beeper from 200 m, and because wolves
can hear other wolves howl about 3 times as far as
humans can (Harrington and Mech 1982), we
assumed that wolves heard the beep >600 m away.
We set up the command center in the center of the
calving pasture from 26 April 1999–15 August 1999
(Figure 3). Monitoring of wolves in 1999 and sub-
sequent years was done mainly from the air, with
weekly aerial locations and infrequent field checks,
including howl surveys (Harrington and Mech
1982).

We were not able to replace the shock collar on
wolf 724F in 2000,but we set up the command cen-
ter with beeper unit only in the calving pasture
from 26 April–August 2000 (Figure 3). We set the
command center in 2000 to activate 2 beepers for
3–5 seconds every 30 minutes.

On 26 May 2001, we captured the second study
animal, an adult female (367F), on the farm. Wolf
367F was lactating when captured and was fitted

with a shock collar and
released 5.3 km north-
west of the farm (Figure
4). Wolf 367F apparently
displaced wolf 724F. Wolf
724F moved to the east
side of the farm, to the
southeast corner of the
pack territory.

From 31 May 2001–13
August 2001, we strategi-
cally located 5 automatic
command centers around
the cattle pasture (Figure
3). On 13 August 2001,
we removed the com-
mand centers from the
farm while conducting
trapping.

Results
We shocked wolf 724F

25 times from 18 May
through 20 July 1998, the
period when her shock
collar was assumed to be
active. Mean distances
moved 1 hour (3.49 km)
and 2 hours (4.72 km)
after being shocked were
greater (P < 0.01) than
normal movements of
1.55 km and 2.98 km,
respectively, for similar
time periods (Table 1).
Repeated shocking did
not affect the size or loca-
tion of her home range.

Shocking did not affect
den- and rendezvous-site
attendance. We located
wolf 724F at the den site
20% of the time (Figure 5)
and at the rendezvous site
48% of the time 2 hours
following a shock (Figure
6). These were similar to
periods when she had not
been shocked (P=0.27).

firmed killed by wolves

on the farm in 1998, but only 1 was killed after the
shock collar was placed on wolf 724F. This calf may
have been killed by other members of the Chase
Brook Pack.

After we recaptured 724F 3.3 km north of the
farm on 26 April 1999, the command center, auto-
matically sending beeps and shocks,seemed to keep
her off the farm. No calf kills were found on the
farm in 1999 (Table 2). We did not locate wolf 724F
on the farm while the command center was active.
The command center operated 24 hours per day, 7
days per week, for >3.5 months without requiring
labor, except for periodic maintenance and moving
the unit from pasture to pasture with the calves.

On 23 December 1999, we approached wolf
724F to within 200 m to see if she would react just

to the sound of the beeper. After a 3-second acti-
vation of the beeper, she moved 0.8 km away from
the beeper within 7 minutes. We also tested the
beeper on 2 other collared alpha female wolves in
2 different packs from similar distances. One wolf
did not move at all in response to the sound of the
beeper, and the second moved toward the unit.

During summer 2000 no active collars were
operating in the Chase Brook Pack, but we placed a
single command center on the farm from late April
through August. Wolf 724F was not detected on the
farm in 2000. Only 2 depredations on calves were
reported on the farm that year.

We captured wolf 367F on the farm on 26 May

2001, after 6 calves had been killed there. We fitted
her with shock and transmitter collars and released
her 5.3 km northwest of the farm. Wolf 367F was
lactating and appeared to have displaced 724F as
the alpha female. Both collared females appeared
to stay off the farm while 5 command centers were
in place there. Wolf depredation resumed on 17
July, when wolves killed a calf on the west side of
the farm after the command centers and most
calves were moved to the east side of the farm.
Trapping by Wildlife Services resumed on 19 July,
and we removed the command centers from the
farm on 15 August. Between 19 July and 16 August,
4 pups and 3 adults were removed from the farm
and translocated 187–270 km to the east. Captures
included 724F, which was captured 1 day after we
removed command centers from the farm. She con-
tinued to react to the beeper when tested in cap-
tivity prior to being translocated. Wolf 367F con-
tinued to occupy the Chase Brook territory,but was
perhaps the only pack survivor by winter, and was
killed by an adjacent pack in January 2002.

Discussion
We found that use of shock collars activated by a

command center may have potential to help reduce
wolf depredation on domestic animals. Our evalu-
ation did not follow rigorous scientific testing pro-
cedures. Rather, we followed an adaptive manage-
ment approach (Walters 1986) to show that shock
collars seemed to reduce wolf depredation on live-
stock in some situations. It appeared the shock col-
lar by itself could drive wolves from farms, but
unless wolves were able to relate the negative stim-
ulus to some aversive signal such as beepers asso-
ciated with the shock, long-term avoidance was not
possible. We did not determine whether other
wolves were affected by shock-collared wolves,
because during most of the period we only had
radiocollars on the wolf with a shock collar. When
an alpha female was caught prior to depredations,
it appeared that all depredations were prevented.
When shock collars were placed on wolves after
depredations had begun, it seemed less likely to
affect other wolves.

Shock collars may be tools for dealing with wolf
depredation in specialized situations, especially
when farms with wolf depredations are surrounded
by or adjacent to land areas where wolves are pro-
tected. It might be possible to use the shock-collar
system in conjunction with sterilization (Mech et

al. 1996) to create “conditioned” packs that do not
produce pups but continue to occupy regular terri-
tories. Under some circumstances, a shock-collar
system may be less costly and longer lasting than
capturing and killing depredating wolves. Because
removal of wolves for translocation and euthaniz-
ing sometimes results in vacated territories rapidly
filled by other wolves (Fritts et al. 1992), efforts to
create “conditioned” packs may be less expensive
than constant trapping efforts. Conditioned packs
maintaining territories may prevent dispersing
wolves from establishing territories and reduce
local coyote abundance (Crabtree and Sheldon
1999), which may further reduce depredation loss-
es.

We believe further studies should continue to
evaluate the effectiveness of shock collars and com-
mand centers on more wolves. Research is needed
to determine more specifically how wolves react to
the shock. More assessment is needed on the long-
term impacts of shock collars on wolves physically
and behaviorally. We need to determine how
wolves not being shocked are reacting to shock-col-
lared animals, to determine this procedure’s effec-
tiveness to alter the pack behavior. If the shock-col-
lar system appears usable as a depredation control
technique, we need to find the most feasible and
cost-effective means for using this system in wolf
management situations.
