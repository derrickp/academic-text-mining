 Abstract: Bands of domestic sheep lambing on the open range in south central Wyoming were monitored

 for predator losses before and following coyote (Canis latrans) removals. Experimental treatments, including
 (1) no removal (control), (2) removal of 2 adults and their pups, and (3) removal of pups only, were replicated

 fectiveness of denning alone.

 Cooperation by the Palm Livestock

 Company and V. E. Dorn is appreciated.

 at which they were killed. The average

 distance from the site of depredations to

 the den was 3.25 km (range 1-10 km).

 Animal remains were found at 77% of the

 dens examined. Sheep remains were found

 in 9 of 31 (29%) adult stomach samples.
 During our study, the density of dens

 of depredating coyotes averaged at least

 1 den/70 km2; 1 area of 80 km2 contained

 5 dens in 1981. These densities are mini-

 mal spring den densities; total coyote den-

 relatively great distances adult coyotes will

 travel to obtain domestic lambs (Young

 and Jackson 1951, Lemm 1973), when less

 "profitable" (i.e., smaller, less abundant,

 and more difficult to capture) prey items
 are found nearer the den. When pups and
 their attendant energy demands are elim-
 inated, it is no longer necessary for adults
 to maximize hunting efficiency and dep-

 redations on lambs should be less intense.

 reduced densities on the more mobile part

 of adjacent coyote populations has not

 been measured, but removing only pups

 may significantly reduce fall depreda-

 tions.

 Because this research indicates that

 D.C.

 depredations upon domestic sheep can be

 alleviated by removing litters of offending

 adult coyotes, one might wonder about

 situations where no pups are born. Coy-

 otes are territorial around a den (Camen-

 zind 1978, Bowen 1982); whether they re-

 main so if pups are removed, or if the

 The contention that it is better to leave

 non-offending coyotes in livestock areas
 than coyotes that may or may not cause

 problems has been mentioned by Boggess

 et al. (1980). As demonstrated in our study,

 the status of offending adults can be

 changed by removing their pups in the
 spring. An important and selective pre-

 ventative control method might be gained

 by manipulating the mechanism (cause)

 that may trigger depredations. Extensive

 studies might determine if a long-range

 behavioral change can be effected. Our

 research has documented the results of

 manipulation after the fact; further re-

 search should probe the efficacy of selec-
 tively preventing depredations. Future re-

 search may provide alternatives to denning

 in resolving coyote depredations, recog-

 nizing the need for both livestock protec-

 tion and the aesthetic and economic value

 of coyotes.
