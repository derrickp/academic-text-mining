 EFFICACY OF DENNING IN ALLEVIATING COYOTE

 DEPREDATIONS UPON DOMESTIC SHEEP

 Abstract: Bands of domestic sheep lambing on the open range in south central Wyoming were monitored
 for predator losses before and following coyote (Canis latrans) removals. Experimental treatments, including
 (1) no removal (control), (2) removal of 2 adults and their pups, and (3) removal of pups only, were replicated
 15 times each. Predation incidents (events) declined 98.2% and the number of sheep killed was reduced by
 98.8% when adults and pups were removed. Removing only litters of pups resulted in a decrease of 87.7%
 in predation incidents and total kills decreased 91.6%. Overall, 23 of 30 predation sequences terminated
 immediately, whereas in all instances predation ceased within 3 days after removing adult coyotes, their
 pups, or both. In terms of "offending individuals," denning can be a selective means of coyote depredation
 control. Removing only litters of offending adults can be nearly as effective in stopping losses as removing
 the adults. Litter size did not appear to influence kill frequencies. A cost-effectiveness analysis is presented.

 J. WILDL. MANAGE. 47(4): 1018-1025

 Depredations by coyotes on domestic
 sheep result in greater losses of domestic
 livestock than any other predator-domes-
 tic prey interaction in the western United
 States (Balser 1974). Although several
 techniques used to alleviate such losses
 have been subjectively ranked with re-
 gard to efficiency, selectivity, and other
 factors (U.S. Dep. Inter. 1978a), there are
 few quantitative data concerning the ef-
 ficacy of any method. A critical response
 (West. Reg. Coordinating Comm., WRCC
 26, 1980) to a recent policy change for
 predator control (memorandum from C.
 D. Andrus to Assistant Secretary for Fish,
 Wildlife, and Parks, 8 November 1980)
 accentuates the need for objective evalu-
 ation of coyote control methods. Our study
 attempted to determine the efficacy of
 "denning," the practice of seeking out the
 dens of depredating coyotes and destroy-
 ing the young, adults, or both in stopping
 depredations upon sheep.

 Denning has been criticized for being
 "unselective" in terms of individual ani-

 mals (Defenders Wildl. 1978, Sierra Club
 1978, Humane Soc. 1978) and removal of

 individuals that obviously are not respon-
 sible for depredations. One author main-
 tains that denning is solely a means of coy-
 ote population reduction (Gier 1968).

 Experienced predator control field per-
 sonnel claim that denning can be a selec-
 tive method for resolving specific depre-
 dation situations. Conceivably, predation
 on domestic sheep by adult coyotes can be
 influenced indirectly by removal of litters
 as opposed to removal of the adults ac-
 tually killing sheep. Anderson (1969:513-
 514), among others, believes predation
 should cease when pups are destroyed.
 Absence of quantitative data leaves these
 questions unanswered.

 Cain et al. (1972) recommended cost-
 benefit analyses of predator control meth-
 ods, stating that such information was yet
 to be collected. Because most depredation
 control programs consist of several meth-
 ods applied simultaneously, the effective-
 ness of a single control method is difficult
 to determine (U.S. Dep. Inter. 1978a). Be-
 cause no other control methods were in

 effect during the present study, except
 winter removal for fur, the opportunity

 was available to measure the cost and ef-

 fectiveness of denning alone.
 Cooperation by the Palm Livestock

 Company and V. E. Dorn is appreciated.
 B. Gilbert provided helpful counsel and
 guidance. This study was supported by
 U.S. Department of Agriculture/SEA Re-
 search Grant 59-2491-02-112-0.

 STUDY AREA

 Fieldwork was conducted in south cen-

 tral Wyoming during April, May, and June
 1980 and 1981, and was concentrated in
 the eastern half of Carbon County. About
 20,000 sheep lamb on the open range with
 sheepherders in attendance. Spring lamb-
 ing range is used until late June when
 sheep are moved onto mountain summer
 range. Lambs are generally shipped in late
 September or October. The study area
 (approximately 2,600 km2) averages 2,000
 m elevation; dominant vegetation con-
 sists of big sagebrush (Artemisia triden-
 tata) and western wheatgrass (Agropyron
 smithii). The topography, vegetation, cli-
 mate, and sheep husbandry practices in
 this area have been described by Tigner
 and Larson (1977).

 METHODS

 Sheep killed by coyotes were located
 and reported to us by sheepherders. Upon
 receiving a report, we went to the area,
 examined all carcasses, and conducted
 necropsies to verify the cause of death.
 Puncture wounds with attendant hemor-

 rhaging were used as evidence of preda-
 tion (Rowley 1970, Bowns 1976). To meet
 test conditions, a threshold of predation
 defined as 3 sheep killed in at least 2 in-
 cidents during 1 week was required. If
 this threshold was attained and other

 predator control methods were not in ef-
 fect (nor anticipated), the particular band
 of sheep was included in this study.

 Once test conditions were met, 1 of 3
 treatments was randomly chosen and ap-
 plied: (1) no coyote removal (control); (2)
 removal of "offending" adult coyotes (in-
 dividuals killing sheep) and their litters;
 and (3) removal of the complete litter but
 not the depredating adults. Depredations
 were monitored for 7 days following com-
 pletion of a treatment. Each treatment was
 replicated 15 times.

 Coyote dens were located by tracking
 adult coyotes away from sheep kills
 (Young and Dobyns 1945). Adult coyotes
 were shot at or near the den sites for treat-

 ment #2. Stomach samples from adults
 were examined in the field for sheep or
 other animal remains. Pups were de-
 stroyed in the dens with a fumigant de-
 scribed by Tigner and Larson (U.S. Dep.
 Inter. 1978b). Fumigated dens were ex-
 cavated and pups counted and weighed.
 Ages of pups were estimated by tooth
 eruption patterns (Bekoff and Jamieson
 1975). A thorough search of the den area
 was made for animal remains. Den sites

 were plotted on a map for density deter-
 mination as well as den locations in rela-

 tion to depredation area. In replications
 of the no-removal (control) treatment, dens
 were not approached or disturbed.

 Efficacy was assessed on the basis of
 changes in both the number of depreda-
 tion incidents (number of times the flock
 was attacked) and the number of sheep
 killed in the week after treatment com-

 pared with the week preceding. Kruskall-
 Wallis, Wilcoxon Signed Rank, and Wil-
 coxon Rank Sum tests (Ott 1977) were used
 to compare number of incidents, number
 of kills, and changes in each as a result of
 treatments.

 Cost-Benefit Analysis

 The cost-effectiveness analysis was based
 on field seasons combined and the follow-
 ing assumptions:

 1. The monitoring intensity did not
 change during pretreatment and post-
 treatment periods. Therefore, the pro-
 portion of coyote-killed sheep that were
 located was probably constant.

 2. The number of sheep killed prior to
 coyote removal treatments accurately
 reflected the number that would have
 been killed had treatments not been

 applied. This assumption was support-
 ed by the kills documented in the con-
 trol.

 3. The wages, expenses, and field time of
 personnel were reasonable for this re-
 gion.

 4. The number of sheep saved does not
 necessarily represent the absolute num-
 ber that would be sold as 45.4-kg (100-
 lb) fat lambs in the fall. Low mortality
 during summer is expected; however,
 we believe that this level of mortality
 is insignificant compared with the
 number of lambs killed by coyotes and
 not located during the experiment. In
 addition, all surviving lambs will not
 weigh 45.4 kg at shipping, and de-
 pending on various factors, some ewe
 lambs are retained for herd replace-
 ments. We believe these conservative

 loss figures serve as a baseline for esti-
 mating the point at which a denning
 program may become cost-effective.

 RESULTS

 In the no-removal treatment, the pre-
 to post-treatment change in numbers of
 incidents and kills was -4.2%. Pre- and

 post-treatment numbers were not differ-
 ent for incidents (T = 9, N = 6, P < 0.05)
 or kills (T = 34, N = 12, P < 0.01). In ad-
 dition, no differences (x2 = 6.89, df = 3,
 P < 0.05) could be shown in total inci-
 dents, or in total kills (x2 = 2.55, df = 3,
 P < 0.05) when pre- and post-treatment
 periods of the no-removal (control) treat-
 ment were compared with the pretreat-

 ment periods of the removal treatments
 (Fig. 1).

 In replications where adults and pups
 were removed, the number of post-treat-
 ment depredation incidents was reduced
 98.2% from pretreatment levels (Table 1).
 The number of post-treatment incidents
 (9 = 0.1) was different (z = 4.98, P <
 0.001) than the number of pretreatment
 incidents (f = 3.7). Following removal of
 adults and pups, the number of kills ob-
 served declined 98.8%. The number of

 post-treatment kills (f = 0.1) was different
 (z = 4.93, P < 0.001) from the number of
 kills observed pretreatment (9 = 5.3).

 Depredation incidents were reduced
 87.7% following removal of pups only
 (Table 1). Among the 15 replications, the

 number of post-treatment incidents (" =
 0.5) differed (z = 4.81, P < 0.001) from
 the number of pretreatment incidents (: =
 3.8), the number of kills observed pre-
 treatment (: = 5.5) was reduced 91.6% and
 differed (z = 4.75, P < 0.001) from the
 number of post-treatment kills (: = 0.5)
 after only litters were removed.

 In 8 of 15 replications, killing stopped
 immediately after removing only the pups
 of offending adults. In each of the other
 7 replications, 1 additional lamb was killed
 within 3 days after removing coyote lit-
 ters. No killing occurred during post-
 treatment days 4 through 7.

 Collectively, treatments involving re-
 moval of adult coyotes, their pups, or both
 were documented in 30 replications. In 22
 of the 30 (73%), killing was stopped im-
 mediately; depredations were terminated
 in all replications 3 days following treat-
 ment.

 Biological Data
 Litter size, weight, or age of pups, and

 the distance between kill sites and the den

 appeared to have little influence upon the
 total number of sheep killed, or the rate

 at which they were killed. The average
 distance from the site of depredations to
 the den was 3.25 km (range 1-10 km).
 Animal remains were found at 77% of the

 dens examined. Sheep remains were found
 in 9 of 31 (29%) adult stomach samples.

 During our study, the density of dens
 of depredating coyotes averaged at least
 1 den/70 km2; 1 area of 80 km2 contained
 5 dens in 1981. These densities are mini-

 mal spring den densities; total coyote den-
 sity was not estimated. Whether the ready
 availability of large numbers of domestic
 lambs resulted in a high density of coyote
 dens is conjectural.

 Cost-effectiveness Analysis

 The average salary for a U.S. Depart-
 ment of Interior Animal Damage Control
 den hunter in Wyoming is $1,020.00/
 month plus $650.00/month in expenses (F.
 Christensen 1980, pers. commun.). Ex-
 penses include vehicle maintenance and
 gasoline, per diem, and miscellaneous
 items such as horse rental. Therefore,
 $1,670.00/month was used in this analy-
 sis. Field personnel are involved in den
 hunting from 15 April until 1 July (2.5
 months or 75 days). Total expenses were
 calculated as: $1,670.00 X 2.5 months X 2
 years = $8,350.00.

 During the 2 field seasons, 40 dens of
 depredating coyotes were located and de-
 stroyed in about 5 months for an average
 of 0.27 dens/day, or roughly 2 dens/week.

 Exact prices are variable, but it seems
 reasonable to use a 5-year (1977-81) av-
 erage of $57.74/cwt for fat lambs mar-
 keted in October as a realistic and accu-

 rate value of lambs lost to coyotes. This,
 of course, assumes that coyote-killed lambs
 would survive to shipping; however, as ac-
 knowledged in assumption #4, this possi-
 ble overestimation of values is probably
 outweighed by other factors. Given that a
 value of $57.74/lamb is reasonable and

 that total expenses incurred amount to
 $8,350.00, the following formulae should
 estimate when the program becomes cost-
 effective. The average expense to locate
 and remove 1 den of offending coyotes
 was $8,350.00/40 = $208.75. This average
 divided by the average value of 1 lamb
 should estimate the number of lambs it
 would be necessary to save to recover costs
 (on a per den basis): $208.75/$57.74 =
 3.62 lambs. The average number of lambs
 killed per week is calculated as the total
 number of kills observed in the control
 treatment, plus all pretreatment kills ob-
 served in removal treatments, divided by
 the number of "den weeks" (i.e., 7-day
 predation sequences attributable to 1 den),
 or 345/70 = 4.93. We assume that an av-
 erage of 4.93 lambs would be killed in an
 average 7-day period. The determination
 of a time period when costs are recovered
 is calculated by dividing the average
 number of lambs required to break even
 (3.62) by the average number of lambs
 killed per week (4.93), which equals 0.73
 week. Provided these rates of predation
 and den removal are reasonable, only
 0.73 X 7 = 5.1 days are necessary to re-
 cover costs.

 DISCUSSION

 Adult coyotes may initiate and continue
 depredations on domestic sheep during the
 pup-rearing season as a means of maxi-
 mizing their hunting efficiency. Royama
 (1970) implied adult predators may do this
 by feeding their young more "profitable"
 prey items than they consume themselves.
 Domestic lambs are possibly the most
 "profitable" prey items available to coy-
 otes at this time of the year because they
 are abundant, easily preyed upon, and
 larger than most prey. Additional cre-
 dence to the hypothesis that coyotes select
 for "profitable" prey when feeding a litter
 of pups may be gained by considering the

 relatively great distances adult coyotes will
 travel to obtain domestic lambs (Young
 and Jackson 1951, Lemm 1973), when less
 "profitable" (i.e., smaller, less abundant,
 and more difficult to capture) prey items
 are found nearer the den. When pups and
 their attendant energy demands are elim-
 inated, it is no longer necessary for adults
 to maximize hunting efficiency and dep-
 redations on lambs should be less intense.

 Learned predatory behavior is another
 factor that influences depredations by
 coyotes on spring lambing ranges. The ex-
 tent to which this factor governs total loss-
 es is speculative, as all adult coyotes rais-
 ing litters in lambing areas may not kill
 lambs. The predilection of some coyotes
 for lambs encompasses more than a sim-
 plified model pertaining to a maximiza-
 tion of the available prey resource.

 Most predator losses occurred before
 docking, when the first accurate count of
 range-born lambs is made. Because it is
 virtually impossible to account for all
 lambs born (Tigner and Larson 1977) and
 for all mortality (Bowns 1976, Nass 1977),
 the percent of each bands' lamb crop lost
 to coyotes was not estimated. Klebenow
 and McAdoo (1976) stated that were it not
 for their efforts in monitoring losses,
 sheepherders would have found less than
 half of the losses that occurred. Losses re-

 sulting when coyotes killed and carried
 small lambs away from the main band
 were not accountable. Consequently, in
 our study, additional depredations may
 have occurred that were not observed.

 Adjustments for such inaccuracies were
 not made. The loss figures must be as-
 sumed minimal; total predator losses must
 be somewhat greater.

 The cost-effectiveness analysis we cal-
 culated is short-term essentially relating
 the immediate benefits of removing of-
 fending adults, their pups, or both in par-
 ticular predation situations. Because pre-

 dation may continue relatively unabated
 unless the sheep are moved, total losses
 inflicted by a pair of coyotes provisioning
 pups could be severe if control measures
 were not implemented. Although lamb
 losses to coyotes are generally highest in
 the spring, another major predation peri-
 od during the late summer or early fall
 has been noted (Klebenow and McAdoo
 1976, Tigner and Larson 1977, Boggess et
 al. 1980). Field personnel assert that fall
 predation is related to learning and de-
 velopment of sheep-killing behavior in
 pups. Lamb losses to coyotes just before
 shipping are most damaging financially
 since the cost of production is nearly com-
 plete and returns have yet to be realized.
 The depredation reduction gained by re-
 moving a pair of offending coyotes or their
 pups from certain areas is potentially
 many times greater than that observed
 immediately, although it is as yet uncer-
 tain whether adults lacking pups will ini-
 tiate depredations in the fall. Long-term
 data sets of predation sequences under
 these circumstances are nonexistent. To

 assume that denning is cost-effective in all
 conditions probably is inappropriate.

 MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS

 Wagner (1972:37) stated that some data
 suggest depredations are reduced follow-
 ing generalized coyote population reduc-
 tion. However, he continues "the evi-
 dence on total sheep losses shows little, if
 any, correlation with density." Denning is
 considered by some (including Gier 1968)
 to be a means of coyote population reduc-
 tion, although others doubt its effective-
 ness (U.S. Dep. Inter. 1978a). When con-
 sidering relatively small areas such as
 lambing ranges, it is possible that pup re-
 moval may effect a temporary population
 reduction. If a population reduction of of-
 fending family groups extends past nor-
 mal lamb shipping dates, a fall predation

 peak may not occur. The effect of such
 reduced densities on the more mobile part
 of adjacent coyote populations has not
 been measured, but removing only pups
 may significantly reduce fall depreda-
 tions.

 Because this research indicates that

 depredations upon domestic sheep can be
 alleviated by removing litters of offending
 adult coyotes, one might wonder about
 situations where no pups are born. Coy-
 otes are territorial around a den (Camen-
 zind 1978, Bowen 1982); whether they re-
 main so if pups are removed, or if the
 female fails to conceive after a pair bond
 is formed and a territory established, is not
 known. Theoretically, without pups, dep-
 redations by coyotes should be less. If such
 coyotes will continue to defend territories,
 excluding others, it is interesting to spec-
 ulate about the efficacy of reducing dep-
 redations on areas with chronic losses, such
 as lambing ranges, by sterilizing resident
 adult coyotes.

 The contention that it is better to leave

 non-offending coyotes in livestock areas
 than coyotes that may or may not cause
 problems has been mentioned by Boggess
 et al. (1980). As demonstrated in our study,
 the status of offending adults can be
 changed by removing their pups in the
 spring. An important and selective pre-
 ventative control method might be gained
 by manipulating the mechanism (cause)
 that may trigger depredations. Extensive
 studies might determine if a long-range
 behavioral change can be effected. Our
 research has documented the results of

 manipulation after the fact; further re-
 search should probe the efficacy of selec-
 tively preventing depredations. Future re-
 search may provide alternatives to denning
 in resolving coyote depredations, recog-
 nizing the need for both livestock protec-
 tion and the aesthetic and economic value

 of coyotes.
