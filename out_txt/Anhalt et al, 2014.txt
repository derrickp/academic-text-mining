Abstract: Bioboundaries, also called biofences, are deterrents that attempt to exploit certain 
innate behaviors to exclude wildlife from target areas. We hypothesized that human-deployed 
scent marks and playbacks of foreign howls could simulate a territorial gray wolf (Canis lupus) 
pack impinging on a resident pack, thereby causing the resident pack to move. During summer 
2010, we deployed a simulated-pack bioboundary near 3 wolf packs in northern Wisconsin 
and monitored their movements relative to 3 wolf packs experiencing a sham treatment, to 
control for effects of human presence. We analyzed wolves' locations (>1 location per week) 
and used linear models with mixed effects to examine distance from the rendezvous site as a 
function of treatment (sham or experimental) and phase of treatment (before or after treatment 
was initiated), while accounting for variations in individual wolves. We found little evidence 
that biofences, as configured and deployed in this study, caused wolves to change use of their 
territory.

G ray w o lv es  (Canis lupus) began to 
recolonize Wisconsin in 1975, and the 
Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources 
(DNR) began monitoring the population in 
1979 (Wydeven et al. 2009). Recolonization has 
resulted in increasing wolf-human conflicts, 
primarily depredations on domestic animals 
and livestock (Ruid et al. 2009).

Cattle (Bos spp.) are the most commonly 
depredated livestock in Wisconsin (Ruid et al. 
2009), and in addition to being economically 
costly, such conflicts likely result in human 
intolerance of wolves (Naughton-Treves 
et al. 2003). Removal of wolves from the 
federal list of threatened and endangered 
species and associated regulations restricting 
take, expanded the range of tools available 
to managers to address conflict, including 
targeted lethal removal of depredators and 
population reduction (Wisconsin DNR 1999). 
However, lethal removal alone may not 
be effective in reducing all depredations. 
Removal through regulated harvest could 
potentially open up territories for new packs

or remove packs which have not had a history 
of depredation (Way and Bruskotter 2012). 
Further, consumptive use, such as hunting 
and trapping, can be controversial and may 
alienate other stakeholders, despite improving 
the tolerance of wolves by other groups (Treves 
and Naughton-Treves 2005).

Use of nonlethal methods may be important 
to both mitigate social concerns associated 
with wolf management and reduce livestock 
depredation (Ruid et al. 2009, Way and 
Bruskotter 2012). Successful nonlethal methods 
include translocation of problem animals, 
livestock guard animals, fladry, and electronic 
guards (Ruid et al. 2009). Other nonlethal 
deterrents are disruptive stimuli, such as 
movement-activated guard devices that emit 
lights and sound via a passive infrared detector 
when activated by an animal, and shock collars 
(Musiani et al. 2003, Rossler et al. 2012). These 
tools, tested on wolves both in the field and in 
captivity, are effective for temporary protection 
of livestock. Adapted animal husbandry, such 
as pasture selection and calving dates, can

prevent livestock depredations in some limited 
situations (Ruid et al. 2009).

Bioboundaries, another class of wildlife 
deterrents, have not been examined extensively 
for wolves. The technique attempts to exploit 
certain innate or learned behaviors to exclude 
wildlife from targeted areas. Territoriality is 
an adaptive behavior that allows animals to 
minimize energy use in a contest over resources 
and might be harnessed to create a bioboundary 
for wolves (Mech and Boitani 2003).

We hypothesized that strategically-placed 
scent marks and recorded howl playbacks 
could be used in conjunction to simulate a 
territorial pack impinging on a resident pack, 
thereby causing the resident pack to move or 
shift its activity. Our objective was to determine 
if a bioboundary deterrent changes wolves' 
use of a territory relative to a sham treatment 
designed to control for human presence 
within a wolf territory. We predicted that the 
distances wolves move would be greater as a 
result of the deterrent, and that movements 
would be directed away from the deterrent. 
If the deterrent had no effect, we predict that 
wolves' movement distances would not change 
with treatment and that movement would be 
random, rather than directional.

Study area
The minimum population count for wolves 

in Wisconsin during the winter of 2009-2010 
was between 690 and 733 wolves in 181 packs 
(Wydeven and Weidenhoeft 2010). These 
wolves occupied 33 counties in the northern and 
central forested region of Wisconsin (Wydeven 
and Weidenhoeft 2010).

We focused on rendezvous sites, which 
represent areas of concentrated use. These 
homesites are used during the post-denning 
period (late spring to early fall), and pack 
members rear and defend pups at these 
locations (Mech and Boitani 2003). Howl 
surveys are a useful method of identifying 
rendezvous sites because responses from both 
pups and adults at the same location during 
the post-denning period indicate a likely 
rendezvous site (Harrington and Mech 1982). 
We conducted howl surveys (23 howl nights, 
104 stops) between June 30 and August 6, 2010, 
along roads in >17 known wolf territories, 
following protocol developed by Harrington

Figure 1 3ray wolf (Canis 'opus; photo courtesy 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service).

and Mech (1982). We were successful in 
identifying rendezvous sites of 6 wolf packs, 5 
of which were located in the northern forested 
region cf Wisconsin in Or.eida, Vilas, and Price 
counties; the other pack was located in Jackson 
County, within the central forested reg.or..

We mapped rendezvous sites using acoustic 
bi-angulation. We estimared :he direction of 
response from both pups and adults, from 1 
observer location using a compass bearing and 
estimated direction of a second response from 
a second observer locadon using a compass 
bearing within 3 hours of the first response. 
However, at 3 of the 6 sites, wolves d.d not 
make a second response. Tc map these sites, 
we estimated the direction of the first response 
using a compass bearing and estimated the 
distance wolves were locazed from the observer 
based cn the volume of the first response. 
Ground searching to map these sites was not 
conducted, as it would have disturbed these 
areas prior to initiating treatment. Each pack 
had >1 animal previously fitted with a VHF 
telemetry collar by the Wisconsin DNR, and 1 
pack had 2 animals collared. Cellared animals 
included known breed mg anc nonbreeding 
animals.

homesites, treatment at all sites began within a 
period of 22 days (between July 18 and August 
8, 2010) and lasted for 15 days. Stimuli on 
experimental treatment sites consisted of howl 
playbacks, and scat and urine scent marks. 
Howling and scent marking complement one 
another in the process of territory maintenance, 
potentially making both vital components of 
a bioboundary. Howling provides long-range, 
immediate information to neighboring packs, 
while scent marking provides more site- 
specific, long-term information (Harrington 
and Mech 1979).

We used howl boxes (Figure 2) to produce 
howl playbacks automatically 3 to 4 times each 
night. Howl boxes (R. Schultz, Wisconsin DNR) 
consisted of a cassette voice recorder (RCA® 
RP3503, Indianapolis, Ind.), timer (Diehl®, 
Series 884, Napperville, 111.), amplifier (Pyle®, 
Brooklyn, N.Y.), directional microphone 
(Bolide Technology Group Inc., San Dimas, 
Calif.), outdoor speaker (Pyle®), and marine 
battery. Depending on site accessibility, we 
placed howl boxes 800 m to 1,200 m from the 
estimated rendezvous site. We created the 
howl playbacks from a parabolic microphone 
recording of a chorus howl of >3 adults and 
pups in the North Averill Creek Pack (Lincoln 
County, Wisconsin) recorded in 1980. Use of 
this recording ensured that the howls would 
be foreign to all packs used in the study. We 
manipulated the recording using Audicity 1.3 
Beta software to create 4 unique playbacks. 
Each playback began with an adult howl to 
simulate a realistic howl sequence. A directional 
microphone and cassette recorder recorded any 
responses by wolves for 5 minutes following 
the first 2 stimuli each night.

We collected fresh scat and urine from a 
Wisconsin wolf pack (Hoffman Lake Pack) 
located >80 km from any study site to insure 
that scents were foreign to all packs being 
studied. We collected urine during the winter 
of 2009 to 2010 and collected scat during May 
and June of 2010. Social status of animals from 
which the scat and urine were collected was 
unknown. On day 1 of treatment, we placed 
scat and urine scent marks at 200-m intervals 
along an 800-m transect on a road or trail near 
the howl box because wolves often use roads 
or trails for travel. We placed urine scent 
marks on vegetation or other natural features

elevated above the ground to simulate a raised- 
leg urination (RLU) of a dominant animal. 
We placed scat (approximately 5 x 2 x 2  cm in 
size) near the simulated RLU and scratched 
the ground with sticks to sirrmare territorial 
marking (Vila et al. 1953). We refresned all 
scent marks twice during treatment, on days 5 
and 10. Scent marks were not removed at the 
end of treatment, but rather allowed to cegrade 
naturally.

At sham-treatment sites, we sought to control 
for the possibility that human presence could 
affect movement at a rendezvous site. We 
deployed howl boxes in the same manner at 
sham-treatment sites as experimental tre atment 
sites, but we did not inriate hcwl playbacks. 
We simulated scent marking by walking 800- 
m transects on a road or trail nearby the howl 
box. Tins treatment ensured ecual exposure to 
human presence at both :he experimental and 
sham-treatment sites.

surveys, a time tested survey technique. 
All monitoring was also conducted during 
the post-denning period, between June 7 
and October 7, 2010. Radio locations were 
provided by the Wisconsin DNR, which 
conducted aerial telemetry during the study 
period (>1 location per week). In addition, we 
used both traditional howl surveys, as well as 
automated howl surveys. These automated 
surveys were conducted using the howl boxes 
at experimental and sham-treatment sites. The 
howl boxes, therefore, served 2 functions in this 
study. Automated surveys were advantageous 
in that they allowed for monitoring of the sites 
more frequently than logistical constraints 
would have otherwise allowed. Automated 
howl surveys were conducted once every 5 
days and consisted of a single adult animal 
howling 3 times from a prerecorded audiotape 
(Harrington and Hanson 1986). Following the 
survey, howl boxes recorded for 5 minutes to 
capture any vocal responses.

Statistical analysis
We developed 4 generalized linear models to 

evaluate wolf movement distances. Movement 
distances were measured between any wolf 
location (from aerial telemetry and howl 
surveys) and 2 reference points: the howl box 
location and the estimated rendezvous site 
location (2 response variables for distance). 
Distances were calculated using ArcMap's 
(Version 9.2) Euclidean distance tool (Table 1). 
Distances were transformed using a box-cox

transformation to meet normality assumptions 
(Sokal and Rohlf 1995). We estimated an optimal 
box-cox parameter using likelihood techniques 
in PROC TRANSREG (SAS 9.2, SAS Institute, 
Cary, N. C.).

All models included the random variable, 
wolf, to account for lack of independence 
in the source of the distance measurements 
(within a pack, telemetry locations came from 
a single individual) and random variable, 
location, to account for method by which the 
animal was located (radio-telemetry or howl 
survey). All models also included date (Julian 
date) to account for serial dependence and the 
natural tendency for attendance at homesites 
to decrease over the summer. Other models 
included treatment, either experimental or 
sham-treatment, and phase, which refers to 
the timing of the location, either before or after 
treatment was initiated. Models were evaluated 
using corrected Akaike's Information Criterion 
(AICc) and Akaike weights (coi) (Burnham and 
Anderson 2002).

We used a parametric concentration parameter 
to test for wolves' directional movement 
(Batschelet 1981). Direction of wolf movement 
was represented by the direction between any 
wolf location and 2 reference points: the howl 
box location and the rendezvous site location. 
Directions were calculated using the same 
extraction procedure in ArcMap (Version 9.2).

21 locations on radio-collared wolves in the 
3 experimental treatment packs and 10, 22, 
15, and 16 locations for radio-collared wolves 
in the 3 sham-treatment packs (1 pack had 2 
animals collared). Wolves responded vocally 6 
times to experimental treatment playbacks (67 
playbacks, or a response rate of 9%). Response 
rate to playbacks was not significantly different 
from responses to all traditional howl surveys 
conducted during the study for rendezvous 
site location and post-treatment monitoring 
(f193 = -0.19, P = 0.85). All responses to playbacks 
occurred within the first 8 days of a 15-day 
treatment period. While in the field, we 
noted increased scent marking and tracks at 
experimental treatment sites (overmarks), 
especially in the vicinity of scent transects. We 
did not quantify overmarks. At 1 site, a radio- 
collared wolf was located via aerial telemetry 
<100 m from the howl box location during day 
2 of treatment.

AICc model selection suggested that response 
variables (i.e., distance from the howl box and 
distance from the rendezvous site) were best 
explained by the date, phase, and treatment 
model, rather than either the models with phase 
or treatment alone or the null model (Table 2). 
Model selection suggested strong support for 
this model (coi = 0.98; Table 2). In the optimal 
model, phase was significant (rendezvous site, 
P = 0.004 and howl box, P = 0.01), but treatment 
was not significant (rendezvous site, P = 0.62 
and howl box, P = 0.77). Movement distance 
was larger during post-treatment for both

response variables. In addition, we calculated 
a parametric concentration parameter for 
each individual wolf and found that none of 
the wolves monitored in the study displayed 
directional movement (Table 3).

Discussion
AIC model selection suggested that both 

distance response variables were best explained 
by the model that included treatment and 
phase. However, examination of fixed effects 
suggested that phase was important, but 
treatment was not. Trie concentration parameter 
test revealed that wolves showed no directional 
movement regardless of whether their pack 
was an experimental or a sham-treatment pack. 
Taken together, there is little evidence that the 
deterrent, as configured and deployed in this 
study, caused wolves to change use of their 
territory.

Previous tests of bioboundaries or biofences 
indicate mixed effectiveness. Ausband et al. 
(2013) explored the use of human-deployed 
scent marks to manipulate wolf movements in 3 
wolf packs in Idaho, USA. Biofences, consisting 
of wolf scat and urine scent marks, were 
deployed in areas of wolf territory within >50% 
kernel density home range estimates. Location 
data from satellite-collared wolves and sign 
surveys, during the first year of trial, indicated 
that wolves either did not trespass biofences 
or trespassed little, while in the second year, 
wolf movements were not affected. In a similar 
effort, Jackson et al. (2012) investigated the

effectiveness of scent-mark deployment to 
contain a pack of translocated wild dogs on 
the Northern Tuli Game Reserve in Botswana, 
Africa. Trials consistently resulted in the pack 
moving toward the center of their territory, 
within the confines of the protected area. 
We expanded upon this work in 2 ways: by 
integrating an additional territoriality cue (i.e., 
howl playbacks) and by using sham treatment 
to control for effects of human presence. Our 
changes were important because significance 
of phase in the AICc-optimal model might 
indicate that wolves changed their movement 
patterns in response to human presence near 
rendezvous sites. In this case, magnitude of 
wolf movements increased after experimental 
and sham treatments were initiated and when 
human presence began. This is consistent with 
literature that demonstrates that even small 
amounts of human disturbance can influence 
wolves' use of their territory. Specifically, 
wolves were more likely to abandon homesites 
and move pups >5 weeks of age in response to 
disturbance (Frame et al. 2007). In Wisconsin, 
pups are 5 weeks of age at approximately the 
third week in May (A. Wydeven, Wisconsin 
DNR, unpublished data).

Older pups are more mobile and more able to 
travel and hunt with the pack, and as a result, 
wolves generally become more nomadic in late 
fall and through the winter (Mech and Boitani 
2003). However, the use of date as a random 
variable should have accounted for variation 
over time, and significance of phase in the best 
model suggests that human activity had an

effect. These results confirm the importance 
of including sham-treatments in experiments 
exploring the effectiveness of biofencing or 
bioboundaries.

Despite little evidence that treatment 
affected wolf movements, wolves responded 
stereotypically to our simulated packs. At some 
experimental treatment sites, wolves responded 
to the playbacks vocally and with increased 
scent marking. This is consistent with findings 
in which resident wolves overmarked 6% of 
human-deployed scent marks on the primary 
line of biofencing (Ausband et al. 2013).

Our results may also indicate something 
about the critical importance of rendezvous 
sites and may provide further support for 
the protections given to these sites in wolf 
management plans. Others have hypothesized 
that when pups are young and immobile or if 
wolves have another critical resource to defend, 
such as a kill, the benefits of remaining at a 
homesite may be high (Harrington and Mech 
1979). If rendezvous sites are a critical resource, 
wolves may choose to remain on the site rather 
than retreat in response to unidentified howls 
and scent marks.

The location of a bioboundary relative to 
the area of concentrated use may be critical in 
determining its effectiveness. Such a deterrent 
may yet prove to be effective in other, more 
peripheral portions of wolf territory that are 
not strongly defended and used frequently. 
Ausband et al. (2013) demonstrated limited 
effectiveness in areas of territories within 
>50% kernel density home range estimates.



216 Human-Wildlife Interactions 8(2)

Alternatively a bioboundary located nearer to 
a homesite than those distances used in this 
study may be necessary to shift movements.

Additionally, structure of the pack might 
influence effectiveness of this deterrent. Well- 
established packs typically use the same 
homesites from year to year and may be less 
likely to abandon them. Bioboundary deterrents 
might be more effective in cases either where 
the pack structure is broken up or in recently 
established rendezvous sites of new wolf packs.

Wolf movement patterns did not appear to 
be influenced by a simulated-pack deterrent. 
However, they did respond to the deterrent 
with territorial marking behaviors similar 
to those they would use to an encroaching 
pack of wolves. Wolves hold and defend 
rendezvous sites tenacioiusly. Altering wolf use 
of rendezvous sites, especially early in summer 
within well-established packs, will be difficult 
to do. These results provide evidence that, in 
general, bioboundaries warrant investigation. 
Bioboundary deterrents should be considered 
as we look to create variety of effective tools to 
work toward reduced human-wildlife conflict.

T imothy R. V an D eelen is an associate 
professcr of wildlife ecology in the Department of 

Forest and Wildlife Ecology at 
the University of Wisconsin- 
Madison. Previous experience 
includes research positions 
with the Wisconsin Department 
of Natural Resources and the 
Illinois Natural History Survey. 
His research and teaching inter­
ests include applied population 
dynamics and the conservation 
of large mammals. His proud­
est professional achievements 

are the successes of his 25+ (current and former) 
graduate students and post-docs, and he holds the 
opinion that he has been privileged to work with the 
best students in the field.

Ronald N. S chultz has worked in the 
Wisconsin wolf program for 32 years as a wildlife 

biologist for the Wisconsin 
Department of Natural Re­
sources. He has been active 
in testing new techniques to 
prevent wolf and livestock 
conflicts in the Great Lakes 
states and in Montana. He 
has also been very active 
in the use of safe-capturing 
devices and immobilization 
techniques to minimize inju­
ries when research trapping 
and when collaring free- 
ranging gray wolves.

A drian P. W ydeven is a forest wildlife spe­
cialist with the Wisconsin Department of Natural 

Resources (WDNR) where

promote and protect wildlife 
habitat through forest man­
agement practices. Previous­
ly, he worked as a nongame 
biologist and mammalian 
ecologist with the WDNR 
where he managed the 
Wisconsin wolf program and 
worked with other nongame 

mammals for over 22 years.
