MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVES RELATIVE TO PREDATORS

J. R. MASON, USDA-APHIS-WS-National Wildlife Research Center, U.C. 5295, Utah
State University, Logan, UT 84322.

Abstract: Predator management to protect livestock, big game, and other species of wildlife
is controversial. Lethal methods, while frequently effective, are increasingly criticized. This
criticism reflects misconceptions about the availability of effective and economical non-
lethal strategies, uncertainty about the effects of lethal control on predator populations, and
the fact that predation continues even when lethal management practices are in place. This
paper reviews various methods available for predation management, with a special focus on
the availability and practicality of non-lethal strategies for game management. The overall
conclusion is that few non-lethal methods are available, although new strategies are being
sought. At present, the most ecologically and economically sound methods of predator
control remain the selective lethal removal of individuals or groups of predators.

INTRODUCTION

 The basic principles of predator
management for game protection are well-
known.  These principles are central to the
discipline and have been recognized as such
for 75 years. Game Management (1933) was
the first text for wildlife professionals; it
remains an important contribution today.1
Aldo Leopold wrote that managing a
property to increase game species
concurrently increases the number of
predators for several reasons (e.g., increases
in both game and buffer species, changes in
predator habits, and influx of predators from
surrounding areas). He cautioned that game
managers should expect predation to
increase as an unavoidable consequence of
successful management. The question was
whether losses would increase to levels that
had significant negative impacts on game
(Leopold 1933:235).

Historically, predation management
has involved the lethal removal of problem
animals (Knowlton et al. 1999). While lethal
control remains an important method for

game protection, these methods are
increasingly unacceptable to the public
(Reiter et al. 1999). Because social values
drive the management of natural resources
(Schmidt et al. 1992), considerable efforts
are being devoted to a search for non-lethal
alternatives (Mason 1997). Such alternatives
are now useful components of strategies to
manage damage by avian species and some
mammalian herbivores (e.g., deer, beavers;
Mason 1997). But non-lethal options for the
management of losses to predators remain
few (Knowlton et al. 1999), particularly in
relation to the protection of wildlife. 

Below, the methods available for
predator management are reviewed, and the
relative utility of these methods in different
contexts is assessed. Because more is
known about coyotes (Canis latrans) than
other species, and since nearly all non-lethal
methods have been developed with coyotes
in mind, this species is emphasized. Lethal
and non-lethal methods are presented
sequentially, but the reader should note that
effective management is always a blend of
strategies and techniques (Slate et. al. 1992).



145

And, prior to any management action,
several fundamental issues should be
considered (Leopold 1933). These are:

1. The density of the game population;
2. The species and densities of predator     
populations;
3. The food preferences of the predator     
species;
4. The physical condition of game and the 
    quality of habitat available to it;
5. The availability and species of buffer
prey      available to predators.

Information pertinent to these
concerns can determine whether predator
control is biologically warranted, which
species of predators require management,
and what practices should be implemented.
Most important, the manager can
objectively decide when management
objectives have been met. A decision model
that subsumes the issues above is used to
guide decision-making in wildlife damage
complaints by USDA-Wildlife Services
(Slate et al. 1992). In the present context,
the useful components of this model are (a)
assess the nature of damage, (b) evaluate
wildlife damage control methods, (c)
formulate a wildlife damage control
strategy, and (d) monitor and evaluate the
results of control actions.

LETHAL METHODS

Most of the lethal methods that are
effective for livestock protection also can be
implemented to protect big game and game
bird populations.  Where state and/or local
regulations permit2, methods include the
selective removal of individual predators by
calling and shooting (e.g., Blejwas,
unpublished manuscript), and population
suppression by aerial hunting, trapping,

snaring and, where livestock are present, the
use of M-44 cyanide ejectors and Livestock
Protection Collars (LPCs) (Knowlton et al.
1999). Factors affecting selection of the
specific method include (a) the nature of the
problem, (b) the presence or absence of
historical loss, (c) the relative size of the
area involved, (d) season of the year and
timing with regard to predation or
anticipated predation, and (e) the efficiency,
selectivity, and efficacy of various methods
of removal (Knowlton et al. 1999).

Population suppression is most often
used when every individual in a predator
population poses a potential threat to game
(Guthery and Beason 1977, Connolly 1978,
Smith et al. 1986, Teer et al. 1991, Cypher
and Scrivner 1992, Henke 1995). Meeting
the goal of suppression usually involves
removing significant numbers of animals
(e.g., > 60%) over relatively large areas
(Stoddart et al. 1989, Pitt et al. 2001)3.
Effecting removals as close as possible to
the anticipated risks both in time (Knowlton
1972) and proximity (Stoddart et al. 1989) is
critical. Even under the most severe removal
regimes (e.g., >90%), coyotes (Canis
latrans) can repopulate areas within 4-5
years (Pitt et al. 2001). Population
suppression is most effective in reducing
predation when removals occur after the
dominance and territorial patterns of
predators are set in any given year, and
immediately prior to whelping.  This timing
reduces the possibility that other individuals
can repopulate an area, establish pair-bonds,
and produce offspring (Knowlton 1972,
Connolly 1978, 1995). At least for coyotes,
this is important because livestock, and,
quite likely, big game fawns are preferred in
many areas by coyotes feeding pups. 

Once suppression is accomplished,



146

the timing of additional predator control will
vary among situations depending on the
species and fecundity of the predators in
question, their rates of  immigration into
removal areas and territory size, and game
abundance in relation to habitat. 

In many instances, the selective
removal of individual predators can
accomplish the same management
objectives as population suppression
(Conner 1995).  This reflects the fact that
territory holders are typically responsible
for depredation on livestock, and by
extension, big game (Till and Knowlton
1983, Sacks 1996) within their territorial
boundaries (Blejwas et al. unpublished
manuscript). Selective removal has the
additional advantage of only removing
offending animals, leaving other individuals
to prey on rodents and other species that
degrade habitat, or in some instances, act as
predators on game themselves(e.g.,
mesopredators that feed on game birds and
their eggs). 

However, the methods used for
selective removal require a high degree of
skill (Knowlton et al. 1999), are time-
consuming, and relatively expensive. As for
population suppression, the timing of
removal is important (Knowlton 1972).

The most selective method for the
removal of territorial animals is calling and
shooting with or without the use of decoy
dogs. For coyotes, this method is easiest to
implement during denning and pup-rearing
(Alcorn 1946, Coolahan 1990), and it can be
used to remove bobcats and fox in some
situations. Although data bearing directly on
the issue are unavailable, selective removals
may be useful in settings where the threat to
big game is analogous to the threat to

breeding livestock. Another highly selective
method for the removal of canid predators
that kill livestock is the Livestock
Protection Collar or LPC (Burns et al. 1988,
1996, Connolly and Burns 1990, Connolly
1993, Rollins 1995). It is probable that
removing coyotes that have learned to kill
sheep could benefit big game in the vicinity
of the livestock.

While all predators have the
potential of causing loss, control actions
should be implemented only when predator
impacts on game populations are sufficient
to warrant concern. The mere presence of
predators in an area is insufficient motive
for management action. Efforts should be
made to systematically census game
numbers and gauge recruitment by young
into the general population in relation to
carrying capacity (Bartmann et al. 1992).
There are situations when the positive
impacts of predators outweigh the losses
they might cause (Gese and Grothe 1995).
Predators control rodent and lagomorph
species that compete with game for food. In
addition, larger predators such as coyotes
will hunt and kill mesopredators (e.g.,
Abrams 1992, Palomares and Caro 1999),
including raccoons (Procyon lotor), skunks
(Mephitis spp., Spilogale putorius,
Conepatus leuconotus),  and foxes (Vulpes
fulva, Urocyon cinereoargenteus) that are
highly effective avian predators (and
arguably more effective than coyotes; see
also Henke and Bryant 1999). Finally, when
game populations are stable and at carrying
capacity (as determined by management
objectives), the presence of predators that
cull surplus animals and thus foster the
production of trophy animals is beneficial
(Bodenchuk et al. 2001).

NON-LETHAL METHODS



147

The majority of non-lethal methods
developed for livestock protection are not
suitable for the protection of wildlife. Of
those methods with potential application,
most have not been evaluated with game
management in mind.

Guard animals 

Dogs, llamas, and donkeys are the
most commonly used livestock guardian
species. The most extensive evaluations
have been with dogs (Linhart et al. 1979,
Coppinger et al. 1983, Black and Green
1984, Green et al. 1984, Green and
Woodruff 1983, 1987), and the evidence
shows that canines are effective in some
settings (e.g. Linhart et al. 1979), but not
others (Timm and Schmidt 1989, Conner
1995).  Reasons for these differences are not
well-understood, but sheep, for example,
can be difficult to protect when they are in
large flocks, dispersed over rough terrain,
and where there is cover that effectively
conceals predators.  Whatever the case,
while dogs are sometimes useful with
livestock, there are few or no situations
where they can be used to protect game.
Wildlife typically prefer habitats where
dogs are least effective, and dogs harass and
kill game (Timm and Schmidt 1989).
Moreover, the presence of dogs precludes
the use of other techniques (e.g., traps,
snares, M-44s) that might otherwise by
implemented to protect game.

Unlike dogs, llamas may have
applications for game protection in some
settings. Recent evaluations with livestock
are promising (Cavalcanti 1997; Meadows
and Knowlton, 2000). Llamas do not require
special feeding programs, are usually
tractable with humans, have a long working
life compared with dogs, and do not

interfere with the implementation of other
predator control methods.  For species of
big game that aggregate during fawning, or
for species of game birds that prefer grass
pastures, the presence of llamas in fenced
pastures could serve as a deterrent to
coyotes, foxes, and feral dogs.

There is little or no evidence that
donkeys are effective guardians for
livestock or wildlife. In fact, donkeys can
behave aggressively towards lambs (W.
Andelt, personal communication). Because
donkeys might also behave aggressively
towards fawns, the use of this species for
wildlife protection s not recommended.

Husbandry

A number of husbandry practices
have been developed to protect livestock
from predators, but few have been
systematically evaluated in terms of
efficacy, cost or benefit. Some of the more
frequently mentioned techniques include:
confining or concentrating flocks during
periods of vulnerability, using herders, shed
lambing, removing livestock carrion from
pastures that might attract predators,
synchronizing birthing to reduce the period
of maximum vulnerability, and pasturing
young animals in areas with little cover and
in close proximity to humans (Robel et al.
1981, Wagner 1988). 
 

Several livestock husbandry
methods could have applicability for
wildlife protection.  Removing carrion that
attracts predators, and synchronizing births
among big game would both be beneficial.
For mule deer and other species, synchrony
can be facilitated by allowing animals to
concentrate during the rut without
harassment or hunting (T. A. Messmer,
personal communication).



148

Habitat manipulation

There are situations in which
invasive exotics, such as tamarack (Tamarix
ramosissima) or undesirable native
vegetation, such as dense stands of juniper
(Juniperus communis), can degrade habitat
and provide cover for predators. The
removal of this vegetation by prescribed
burning or other methods (e.g., chaining)
can improve habitat for native species,
increase beneficial forage plants, and
diminish predation risk.

Fencing

Barriers can exclude mammalian
predators and deter their use of specific
areas (DeCalesta and Cropsey 1978, Linhart
et al. 1982, Shelton 1984, 1987, Nass and
Theade 1988). Fencing also can increase the
efficiency with which predators can be
removed when necessary (Knowlton et al.
1999). However, no fence is completely
predator-proof, and at the very least,
periodic selective removals of predators that
cross fences may be necessary (e.g., Shelton
and Wade 1979).  Most likely, electric
fences are more effective than non-electric
fences, with effectiveness dependent upon
post and wire spacing, number of wires,
fence height and fence maintenance (Green
et al. 1994)4. Existing fences can be
retrofitted with electric strands attached to
offset insulators to exclude canid predators.
Hi-tensile electric fences are effective
against mountain lions (Felis concolor) and
bears, as well as canids (Pratt 1990). An
important caveat is that predator fencing can
hamper the movement of wildlife (e.g.,
antelope, Antilocapta americana). 

Fladry 

Recent reports suggest that cloth or

plastic flagging on single strand fences (i.e.,
fladry) can prevent wolf depredation on
livestock and game (Musiani et. al. 2000).
At the least, this possibility remains
controversial. Whether or not fladry is an
effective deterrent to wolves (Canis lupus)
and whether they have any utility for the
protection of big game is untested.  No data
have been collected with coyotes or other
predators (e.g., bobcats, Lynx rufus).
Because flagging is attractive to cats and
commonly used as a visual trap attractant
for coyotes (Mason et al. 1999), the
technique is unlikely to be effective except
in specialized circumstances.

Electronic devices  

Apparatuses that periodically emit
bursts of light or sound can temporarily (3-4
weeks) deter predation on livestock in
fenced pastures (Linhart et al.1992, Linhart
1984a,b, Linhart et al.1984) and on the open
range (Linhart et al. 1992, Bomford and
O'Brien 1990, Koehler et al. 1990). The
duration of effectiveness can be increased
when devices (such as the Electronic Guard
available from the Pocatello Supply Depot)
are used in appropriate numbers
(approximately 1 per 10-15 acres), moved
periodically, and programmed to vary the
temporal pattern of stimulus presentations.
Use of such frightening devices is not
widespread even for livestock protection, in
part because operating sirens and strobe
lights at night near people is unacceptable,
and because the strategy is costly and labor-
intensive5.  Although there are no published
data, the likelihood is that devices that
frighten predators will also frighten big
game, and that habituation to the devices by
big game will approximate habituation by
predators. The devices might be less
upsetting to game birds and, when used in
combination with other strategies,



149

frightening devices might have utility for
small game protection. There are anecdotal
reports consistent with this possibility (R.
Johnson, personal communication).

Repellents and learned aversions

There are no commercially available
predator repellents with demonstrated
effectiveness6. While sensory repellents
such as quinine hydrochloride and capsaicin
discourage coyote damage to inanimate
objects (Werner et al. 1997), these
substances are not commercially available
for this purpose, and there is no evidence
that they deter attacks on live prey (Lehner
1987). Instead, the available data suggest
that predation continues despite the
presence of these materials, although
predators sometimes redirect attacks to
avoid sites treated with highest
concentrations of repellent (Burns and
Mason 1997).

There are a few repellents that
reduce food consumption by captive
predators. These include pulegone,
cinnamaldehyde, and allyl sulfide (Hoover
1996). The possibility exists that these or
similar substances may be useful to deter
predators from feeding on eggs. However,
none of these substances are registered with
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
a prerequisite for their sale (Hushon 1997).
Registration costs are invariably high, and
sometimes exceed several million dollars.
This is true even when the materials in
question are harmless, and already approved
for use in human and animal feeds by other
federal agencies7.

Conditioned taste aversion (CTA),
using lithium chloride or other emetic
compounds to make animals sick, has been
tested as a way to reduce depredation by

coyotes, resolve nuisance issues with black
bears (Ursus americanus, Ternent and
Garshelis 1999), and curtail egg predation
by raccoons, skunks, mongooses, ravens and
crows (Corvus spp.) (e.g., Semel and
Nicolaus 1992, Nicolaus et al. 1982, 1983,
Nicolaus and Nellis 1987).  Although no
CTA method has been approved for use by
the U.S. EPA, the available evidence
concerning egg depredation is promising.
Provided that ‘poisoned eggs’ resemble the
eggs to be protected, and that alternative
foods are readily available, significant
reductions in loss are usually observed. Not
so with livestock predation. So far as sheep-
killing by coyotes is concerned, the results
are equivocal. Some investigators report
success (Gustavson et al.1974, Ellins and
Martin 1981, Gustavson et al.1982,
Forthman-Quick et al.1985a,b), and others
reporting failure (Conover et al. 1977, Burns
1980, Bourne and Dorrance 1982, Burns
1983, Burns and Connolly 1985). Ten years
after the most extensive field trial involving
use of lithium chloride (Gustavson et al.
1982, Jelinski et al. 1983), a survey of
participating sheep producers showed that
while 54% of the participants initially
considered CTA  "successful" or "somewhat
successful," only one still used it (Conover
and Kessler 1994). There are no data that
bear directly on the use CTA to protect big
game. CTA, as attempted to date, should not
be considered as a method to protect
livestock or big game. 

Reproductive interference

For more than 25 years, sterilants
and abortifacients have been tested as
strategies to control over-abundant wildlife
such as while-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus) and non-migratory populations
of Canada geese (Branta canadensis)
(Miller 1995, DeLiberto et al. 1998). The



150

results of these investigations have been
ambiguous.  Despite continuing public
support of sterilization as an alternative
(Lauber and Knuth 2000), no reproductive
inhibitor has been used to successfully drive
declines in wildlife numbers regardless of
the species considered.

Reproductive interference to control
predator behavior (rather than to reduce
their numbers) is now receiving
considerable attention as a strategy to
control coyote damage. The strategy is
predicated on research showing that
depredation can be reduced by removing
pups of depredating coyotes (Till and
Knowlton 1983, Sacks 1996, Zemlicka
1995).
  

Recently, Bromley and Gese
completed an investigation of sterilization
as a method of reducing coyote predation on
domestic sheep (Bromley 2000).  In the
winter of 1998, these investigators
surgically sterilized and radio-collared
members of 5 coyote packs, while 6 packs
remained intact. The following summer, the
5 sterile packs killed one lamb, while the 6
intact packs killed 11 lambs. During the
winter of 1999, the investigators monitored
4 sterile packs and 8 intact packs. The
following summer, the sterile packs killed 3
lambs while the intact packs killed 22
lambs. The significance of these results for
wildlife management is twofold. First,
surgical sterilization could have benefits for
the protection of big game fawns. Second,
surgical sterilization is a tool that could be
used almost immediately by any game
manager following training in the relevant
surgical procedures.
 

Important caveats to the use of
sterilization to manage depredation are first
that the method only has demonstrated

utility with coyotes, and second, that it is
probably effective only when fawning and
pup-rearing coincide. When these events are
asynchronous, sterilization may not
influence loss. For example, in north-coastal
California, depredations peak during a
lambing season which is out-of-phase with
pup-rearing (Scrivner et al. 1985, Conner
1995, Sacks 1996).  In this situation,
presence of lambs, not the presence of pups,
is the important determinant of predation
patterns in some situations. Because birthing
seasons in some areas of Texas may be
asynchronous with pup production,
sterilization may be useful in some areas but
not others.

CONCLUSIONS

Integrated strategies, involving both
lethal and non-lethal methods, are required
for effective predator control. However,
despite extensive on-going research,
effective non-lethal strategies do not exist
for many wildlife applications. Every
situation is different, and no simple
solutions apply. There will be settings in
which reductions in predator numbers are
unwarranted. These include instances where
game is close to carrying capacity, or when
the removal of relatively unimportant
predators (e.g., coyotes in relation to quail)
permits the number of relatively important
predators (e.g., foxes, raccoons, skunks) to
increase. Whenever possible, small
properties should band together in
coordinated management plans that increase
the acreage under control. Otherwise,
predators will move into managed ‘sinks’
from surrounding unmanaged areas, and
swamp whatever benefits might accrue from
individual management plans. 

Whatever the strategy, habitat
manipulations alone are often insufficient to



151

increase game numbers, so that they meet
management expectations. Large sums can
be expended acquiring and improving
habitat, but the success or failure of an
entire management scheme may depend on
whether or not predator management is a
component of the overall management plan.

1 Aldo Leopold’s classic text on this subject is
clear and informative.  Reading this book is
beneficial to anyone interested in the basic
principles of habitat and wildlife management.

2 Wildlife damage control methods are subject to
legal and administrative constraints.  Some
methods are legal in one state but not in others,
or only in portions of a state.  The status of the
target species (state or federally listed as
threatened or endangered), or the presence of
listed species in the area where control activities
are proposed may preclude use of a method.
Also, wildlife damage control programs may
restrict the use of specific methods by policy or
agreement with other parties.  The important
questions are: (a) is the method legally and
administratively permissible with the species in
question, (b) is the method legally and
administratively available to resolve the damage
in question, (c) is the method legally and
administratively available for use at the specific
site in question or are there restrictions because
of land class, other land use patterns, or the
presence of listed species near the site of
damage.  Finally, there are additional constraints
that vary from state to state concerning who is
authorized to apply methods.

3 As a general rule, the larger the area of
supression, the better the result (Stoddart et al.
1989).  Smaller properties should consider
cooperating in predator management efforts.

4 Practical information about fencing and other
options for coyotes and other predators is
available in Prevention and Control of Wildlife
Damage, published by the Cooperative
Extension Service of the University of
Nebraska, the Great Plains Agricultural Council,
and USDA-APHIS-WS.

5 Scientists at the National Wildlife Research
Center are developing considerably smaller
units than those currently available.  These new
apparatuses also have the option of activation
only when a predator is detected nearby (J.
Shivik, personal communication).

6 There are products containing bone tar oil that
are sold as predator deterrents in Canada and in
the United Kingdom (e. G., Renardine).  These
substances are not repellents and may in fact
attract some predator species (Zemlicka and
Mason 2001).

7 As an example, methyl anthranilate is the
active ingredient in a number of bird repellents.
This chemical has been commercially available
as an FDA-approved human and animal food
flavoring for more than 50 years.  In order to
obtain a registration with the U. S. EPA for this
product, the company involved spent 5 years
and $5 million dollars (P. Voght, ReJex-It
Incorporated, personal communication).
