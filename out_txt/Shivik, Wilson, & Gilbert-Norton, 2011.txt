ABSTRACT Highly territorial species such as coyotes (Canis latrans) use scent-marks to delineate bound-
aries, and it has been suggested that canids may be repelled from areas by using human-placed scent-marks.
To evaluate the potential of artificial scent-marks as an area repellent, we first established treatment and
control plots within theWelderWildlife Refuge in southern Texas, USA. There, we usedGlobal Positioning
System collars with 15-min acquisition rates on 3 coyotes to evaluate differential coyote response to artificial
scent-marks and control areas within coyote territories. Second, to directly evaluate behaviors, we observed
the responses of 8 coyotes to control and treatment plots within 1-ha pens at the Predator Research Facility in
Logan, Utah, USA. In treatment conditions, a technician walked the boundary of the simulated territory and
sprayed coyote urine. In control conditions, a technician walked along the boundary but did not distribute
artificial scent-marks. In the field, coyotes visited treatment plots more than control plots (P ¼ 0.09) and
traveled within treatment plots more than control plots (P ¼ 0.05). In direct observations, coyotes investi-
gated treated boundaries and spent more time at them (P ¼ 0.001). Coyotes also visited the interiors of
treatment areas nearly twice as often as control areas (P ¼ 0.013). Sample sizes were limited, but based on
these results, we cannot recommend using artificial territories (delineated with human-placed coyote urine)
to repel coyotes from areas where resource protection is needed. � 2011 The Wildlife Society.

KEY WORDS bio-boundary, Canis latrans, coyote, nonlethal, repellent, urine.

Scent-marking behavior is common to many mammalian
species, and one of its most recognized functions is to assist
with territorial delineation and defense (Hediger 1949,
Mykytowycz 1968, Johnson 1973). Simple marks, such as
urine and scat, may provide a less costly means of defending a
territory than direct confrontation, and many species of
carnivores use scent-marking to signal territorial occupancy
and to deter other conspecifics from entering (Smith et al.
1989, Allen et al. 1999, Stewart et al. 2001).
Territorial marking is well-documented in feral dogs (Canis

familiaris; Pal 2003), gray wolves (C. lupus; Rothman and
Mech 1979, Paquet 1992), and Ethiopian wolves
(C. simensis; Sillero-Zubiri and MacDonald 1998). Scent-
marking in coyotes (C. latrans) has been particularly well-
described (Barrette and Messier 1980, Bowen and
McTaggart Cowan 1980, Wells and Bekoff 1981) and stud-
ied in wider ecological contexts (Paquet 1992, Gese and Ruff
1997, Bekoff and Gese 2003). For coyotes in particular,
territorial boundaries have been accurately mapped by ob-
serving scent-marking behaviors (Shivik and Gese 2000).
Territorial boundaries can remain stable for decades (Young
et al. 2006).

After urine was described as a means to repel wolves in �1
published anecdote (Mowat 1963), other authors have called
for creating artificial scent-mark ‘‘bio-boundaries’’ to help
manage species such as African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus;
Apps 2009). The technique is not without theoretical draw-
backs, however, because coyote urine and scat are more
generally used as a coyote lure rather than as a repellent
(Shivik et al. 2003) and coyotes will intrude into neighboring
territories (Shivik et al. 1996, Gese and Ruff 1997, Allen
et al. 1999). Whether or not a simple application of artificial
scent-marks will repel coyotes is an important question
because livestock depredation by coyotes is a serious problem
and evaluation of potential management techniques is nec-
essary (Knowlton et al. 1999, Shivik 2006). Therefore, we
performed 2 experiments to examine the hypothesis that
coyotes will avoid an area delineated by human-placed coyote
scent-marks. In the first study, we indirectly observed visits
of free-ranging coyotes exposed to treatment (areas delin-
eated with coyote urine) and control areas (areas without
scent-marks); in the second study, we directly observed
captive coyote behavioral responses to treatment and control
areas.

Texas, USA. The study area was located in a transition zone
between the gulf prairies and marshes and South Texas
plains, and vegetation consisted mainly of mixed grasslands
and shrubs (Young et al. 2006). Coyote territories formed a
continuous patchwork across the refuge, with approximately
7–8 territories always present and exhibiting high spatial
stability through time (Young et al. 2006).

Predator Research Facility
Our direct observations were performed at the National
Wildlife Research Center (NWRC) Predator Research
Facility inMillville, Utah, USA. Elevation at the field station
was 1,381 m above sea level, and average yearly temperatures
ranged from �118 C to 328 C, with average annual precipi-
tation of 42 cm and snowfall of 82 cm. The NWRC held a
large population (n ¼ 106) of coyotes, kept individually and
in pairs in a variety of captive outdoor environments.

METHODS

Work was approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committees for both Utah State University and Wildlife
Services NWRC (QA 1311 and 1453; USU: 1304).

Welder Wildlife Refuge
We captured coyotes from April 2007 to April 2009, using
padded leg-hold traps (Victor no. 3 Softcatch, Lititz, PA),
collarums (Wildlife Control Supplies, East Granby, CT),
and neck snares (fitted with stops to prevent choking). Once
captured, we physically immobilized coyotes and fitted them
with a Global Positioning System collar (GPS3300S; Lotek,
New Market, ON, Canada). We programed GPS collars to
acquire locations every 15 min and to automatically release
from coyotes for data retrieval after 6–18 months. Seven
coyotes were initially tracked using a directional antenna and
triangulation for >10 weeks to identify home ranges so that
control and treatment plots could be established within each
coyote’s area of normal use.
For experimental plots, we identified 1–2 naturally occur-

ring 2-ha clearings (grassland–shrub community as would be
used for livestock grazing) separated by>100 m within each
study animal’s home range. Once clearings were identified,
each was randomly assigned as a control or treatment plot.
The treatment (artificial territory) was established by distrib-
uting scent-marks of coyote urine. We used a spray bottle to
apply 1–2 mL of coyote urine (Wildlife Control Supplies)
every 2–3 m along the periphery of the treatment plot.
Boundaries of plots were delineated by the technician using
vegetation and no artificial markers were placed. Because
technicians create artificial boundaries, human scent and
presence is confounded with dispersion of scent-marks.
Therefore, we controlled for human presence in experiments;
that is, human activity at control plots was identical (walking
along the boundary) to that at treatment plots except that no
scent-marks were left. We recorded the number of times
collared coyotes entered the control and treatment plots for
4 weeks after application of scent-marks.
Our hypothesis was that coyotes would avoid entering a

plot that was surrounded by scent-marks from a foreign
conspecific. Specifically, visitation to control plots would

be higher than that to treatment plots. Additionally, we
hypothesized that if coyotes entered control and treatment
plots, forays would be of short duration and the distance
traveled within plots would be less within treatment versus
control areas. We used each coyote as the sample unit, and
compared visitation and distance traveled within control and
treatment plots using paired t-tests. Statistically, we hypoth-
esized that the mean difference score (control � treatment)
would be greater than zero for visits to, and distance traveled
within, experimental plots.

Predator Research Facility
We used 8 adult coyotes (4 M–F pairs) for direct observation
of behavioral response to treatments. Pairs were housed in
1-ha environments that contained natural fallow pasture
vegetation (grass and alfalfa mixture), a wooden shade
shelter and 2 kennels. Environments were wedge-shaped
and extended 160 m from a raised central observation build-
ing to an outer arc 125 m wide.
In previous studies at the facility, the behavioral repertoire

of captive coyotes housed in pairs and larger pens was found
to be equivalent to that exhibited by wild coyotes (Shivik
et al. 2009). Thus, coyotes were tested in established pairs in
order to mimic wild coyote sociality and to strengthen the
inference of our results. As with studies on packs in the field,
the sample unit in experiments was the individual coyote.
To establish a simulated territory, we delimited a

57-m � 22-m � 57-m triangular area within the pen.
The boundaries of the area were not marked on the substrate
but were identified using fixed references (e.g., exterior posts
and a shade shelter within the pen). The total area of the
designated territory was 697 m2 and comprised 6.95% of the
total pen area. Two simulated boundary treatments were
applied. In the human control treatment, the technician
walked along the designated territory boundary, but in the
simulated territory treatment, the same technician walked
the boundary but placed coyote scat and urine at each corner
and halfway along each length of the boundary.We used scat
and urine from 2male and 2 female coyotes at the facility that
were unrelated to the test animals.
The first trial period was from 5 to 18 October 2006.

During this period, 4 (2 randomly chosen pairs) coyotes
received the human control, and the other 4 received the
simulated territory treatment. In the second testing period
(19 Oct–2 Nov) treatments were swapped for each pair so
that all coyotes received both treatments in a counterbal-
anced repeated-measures design. During each trial period,
the technician walked the boundary on 6 nonconsecutive
days between 1000 hours and 1100 hours.
For analysis of behavioral response to treatments, we di-

rectly observed coyote responses to treatments. Observations
began when the technician finished walking the perimeter
of the designated boundary and were terminated after 1 hr.
We made 48 hr of observations (6 hr/coyote). Behavior was
recorded directly from an observation building using Noldus
Observer1 (Noldus, Leesburg, VA) software on a laptop.
We recorded the latency of coyotes to approach control and
simulated territory boundaries, the number of visits to the

Shivik et al. � Simulated Coyote Territory 495



boundary, the duration of time spent on a boundary, and the
number of scent-marks left by each animal. Similarly, we
recorded the latency to enter the delineated territorial space,
the number of visits to the space, and the duration of time
spent within the delineated territory.We assessed differences
in coyote response to control and simulated territorial
boundaries using paired t-tests.

RESULTS

Welder Wildlife Refuge
Using test-collars at fixed, known locations, we determined
that GPS locations were very accurate during data collection,
with a mean location error of 19.3 m (SD ¼ 13.8 m). Seven
coyote territories had control and treatment plots applied,
but most GPS collars failed to release and, thus, data were
available for only 3 coyotes. All 3 coyotes used spatially
distinct home ranges and were assumed to be from 3 different
territories.
The periphery of the treatment plot for adult male M660

was sprayed with urine once (10 Sep 2007) and during the
observation period it was found one time within the control
plot and 10 times within the treatment plot; it traveled
469 m in the control plot and 913 m in the treatment
plot. The periphery of the treatment plot for adult female
coyote F610 was sprayed with urine twice (22 Jan 2009, 11
Feb 2009). Coyote F610 was found 9 times within its 2
control plots and 26 times within the 2 treatment plots; it
traveled 2,375 m in the control plots and 3,249 m in the
treatment plots. The treatment plot for adult female coyote
F6202 was sprayed once (24 Apr 2009). Coyote F6202 was
found in the 2 control plots 24 times and 71 times in the
treatment plots; it traveled 4,705 m in the control plots and
4,973 m in the treatment plots.
Mean number of visits was 11.4 and 35.6 to control and

treatment plots, respectively. Mean distance traveled was
2,516.3 m within control and 3,045 m within treatment
plots. Coyotes visited treatment plots more than control
plots (t ¼ �2.1, df ¼ 2, P ¼ 0.09) and traveled more within
treatment plots than control plots (t ¼ �2.94, df ¼ 2,
P ¼ 0.05).
Predator Research Facility
Differences in coyote response to a human-delineated
boundary versus a boundary delineated with coyote urine
were readily apparent (Table 1). The observed trend was
opposite to expectations, however, in that coyotes investi-

gated treated boundaries and spent more time at them rather
than avoiding areas that were marked. Differences in intru-
sions into the delineated territorial space were also apparent
between control and treatment trials (Table 1). Latency to
enter the artificial territory was similar between control and
treatment conditions, but coyotes visited nearly twice as
many times, and spent more time in areas that were
scent-marked versus control areas.

DISCUSSION

Wild coyotes visited artificially scent-marked plots nearly 3
times as much as control plots and traveled significantly more
within treatment plots, although the effect size was not as
large (20% increase). Captive coyotes initially responded
to both humans and scent-marks equivalently in that the
latency to investigate was not statistically different between
control and treatment conditions, but overall, coyotes
investigated treatment boundaries far more than control
ones. Thus, the coyote scent-marks had greater biological
significance than human scent controls.
Alternate explanations for our negative results are possible.

For example, we laid scent-marks relatively infrequently;
such a schedule would be practical from a management
perspective, but may not be sufficiently representative of
natural marking behavior in coyotes. Coyotes in the wild
often scent-mark several times a day along their territory
boundary, depending upon social status, time of year, and
territory size (Gese and Ruff 1997). Also, coyote response to
scent-marks is lower through time and a function of mark
degradation (Harris 1983, Windberg 1996). In our study,
artificial boundaries were created in clearings within coyote
territories rather than along boundary edges, which could
have influenced the motivation of coyotes to intrude. In
actual management situations, however, livestock are not
grazed only on the peripheries of coyote territories and
our experimental design accounted for this. Another factor
that should be addressed when considering the likely success
of a simulated scent boundary is a coyote’s motivation to
trespass. Bowen andMcTaggart Cowan (1980) reported that
adjacent coyotes trespassed into a conspecific territory when a
carcass was present, but vigorously marked and adhered to
boundaries when it was not. Similarly, Shivik et al. (1996)
showed that resident coyotes will follow sheep into other
coyote’s core areas. We suspect that coyote intrusions
could have been more frequent if an attractive resource

was provided in experimental plots. Scent-marks may not
be enough because ultimately coyotes successfully hold
territories through physical confrontation and expulsion of
intruders (Gese and Ruff 1997, Gese 2001).
The sample size in our field study was limited due to

failures of the release mechanisms on collars and the loss
of data. Our conclusions are robust overall, however, because
all 11 coyotes in 2 independent experiments were attracted to
areas with artificial scent-marks and not repelled as hypoth-
esized. Indeed, it was apparent that the scent of a foreign
coyote within the territory of another coyote was a strong
attractant that encouraged investigative behavior and intru-
sions. Whether a coyote that is investigating foreign scent-
marks is distracted and, thus, less likely to attack livestock
within an encircled area, however, is an interesting question
worthy of additional research.

MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS

Because coyotes will increase intrusions across a simulated
boundary, artificial scent-marking is not likely to be a bene-
ficial management technique. Although scent-marked
boundaries do influence coyote behavior under natural con-
ditions, our knowledge of all of the stimuli needed to repel
intruders is currently limited. Further understanding of ter-
ritorial defense behaviors is needed before the phenomenon
can be adopted as an area repellent for coyotes.
