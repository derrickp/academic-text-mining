 SURGICAL STERILIZATION AS A METHOD OF REDUCING COYOTE

 PREDATION ON DOMESTIC SHEEP

 Abstract: Predation by coyotes (Canis latrans) on domestic sheep is a problem for many livestock producers through-
 out the United States Intermountain West. We examined whether surgical sterilization of coyote packs would mod-
 ify their predatory behavior and reduce predation rates on domestic sheep as compared to coyote packs with pups.
 FromJune 1997 to December 1997, we gathered baseline information on coyote pack size and movements. In win-
 ter 1998, we surgically sterilized and radiocollared members of 5 coyote packs. We also captured and radiocollared
 members of 6 packs that remained intact (i.e., reproductive). During summer 1998, only 1 sterile pack killed a lamb,
 while 3 intact packs killed 11 lambs. When only sheep-killing packs were included, sterile packs killed an average of
 0.35 lambs/week, while intact packs killed 1.53 lambs/week in 1998. During winter 1999, we monitored 4 sterile and
 8 intact packs. In summer 1999, 3 sterile packs killed 3 lambs, while 4 intact packs killed 22 lambs. Considering only
 sheep-killing packs, sterile packs killed on average 0.38 lambs/week, while intact packs killed an average of 2.95
 lambs/week in 1999. Coyotes were more likely to kill lambs that were on the edges of coyote territories as com-
 pared to core areas. Lambs of less than average weight were also more likely to be killed by coyotes. The available
 rodent biomass in each territory was not an influence on the differential kill rates exhibited between sterile and
 intact packs, nor did the amount of available alternate prey influence annual coyote predation rates on sheep. We
 conclude that we could use surgical sterilization to modify the predatory behavior of coyotes associated with pup pro-
 duction and provisioning of pups. Sterilization successfully reduced, but did not eliminate, coyote predation on
 domestic sheep. The amount of losses averted in the first year exceeded the costs associated with surgically steriliz-
 ing a coyote pack, which indicates that surgical sterilization could prove beneficial on small-scale livestock operations.

 Coyotes are a major predator of domestic sheep
 and lambs throughout the western United States.
 Pearson (1986) reported that 2.5% of adult sheep
 and 9.0% of lambs were lost to predators annual-
 ly; coyotes were the major predator accounting
 for 74% and 78% of adult sheep and lamb losses,
 respectively. In 1994, predators accounted for
 the loss of 520,600 sheep and lambs, and coyotes
 caused 62% of those losses (Simpson 1995). Utah
 ranchers reported the loss of 19,000 sheep and
 lambs to coyotes in 1997 (31.3% of total losses;
 U.S. Department of Agriculture 1998). Sheep
 producers have cited high predation losses, low
 lamb and wool prices, and a shortage of good
 hired labor as reasons for leaving the sheep
 industry (Gee et al. 1977).
 Traditionally, lethal nonspecific methods have

 been used to reduce or stop coyote predation,
 assuming that fewer coyotes means fewer livestock
 losses. Recent research in California suggests that

 breeding pairs of coyotes are responsible for
 most of the killing (Sacks et al. 1999) and that tar-
 geting breeding individuals may be a more effec-
 tive control method. In addition, attitudes to-
 ward lethal control have changed (Andelt 1996,
 Reiter et al. 1999), and a variety of nonlethal con-
 trol methods are now available or in practice.
 Currently, nonlethal control methods include
 various livestock husbandry practices, fencing,
 guard animals (dogs, llamas, and other aggressive
 livestock), and frightening devices (Andelt 1987,
 Knowlton et al. 1999). Aversive conditioning,
 repellents, and antifertility agents have been
 explored as a means to reduce coyote popula-
 tions and/or livestock losses (Balser 1964,
 Bourne and Dorrance 1982, Lehner 1987). How-
 ever, costs of labor and materials, maintenance,
 and lack of success in open range situations have
 limited the use of many nonlethal control tech-
 niques and made those techniques difficult to
 promote among sheep producers (Knowlton et
 al. 1999).
 The use of fertility control as a nonlethal

 method to manage wildlife populations has
 prompted increasing interest in recent years

 (Garrott 1995). Most efforts have focused on
 developing and testing various contraceptive sub-
 stances (Elder 1964, Stellfug et al. 1978, Millar et
 al. 1989) or methods of drug administration
 (Matschke 1977, Plotka and Seal 1989, Kirk-
 patrick et al. 1990). Computer models that illus-
 trate the potential of canid fertility control have
 been developed (Haight and Mech 1997, Pech et
 al. 1997). Research designed to evaluate the
 potential of canid fertility control has document-
 ed changes in reproduction (Balser 1964) as well
 as behavioral responses to sterilization (Mech et
 al. 1996, Saunders and McIlroy 1996, Bubela
 1999). However, no studies have addressed the
 effect of sterilization on depredation behavior.
 Till and Knowlton (1983) showed that predation

 on domestic lambs by adult coyotes stopped when
 their pups were removed. They theorized that
 sterilizing territorial coyotes could be more effec-
 tive than removing the pups of depredating adults
 because (1) no lamb loss would occur before the
 pups were removed; (2) the sterilized coyotes
 may keep out other reproductive coyotes that
 might cause sheep losses; and (3) sterilization may
 reduce losses for many years because pair bonds
 between coyotes are long-lasting. Implicit in this
 theory are the untested assumptions that (1) steril-
 ized resident (or dominant) coyotes maintain their
 territories to the exclusion of nonsterilized coy-
 otes; (2) sterilization has the same effects as pup
 removal; and (3) compensatory mechanisms with-
 in the population do not counteract the effects of
 sterilization. We did not attempt to control the
 size of the coyote population, but only modify
 predatory behavior. We hypothesized that sterile
 coyotes, without the energetic demands of provi-
 sioning pups, would kill fewer sheep than coyotes
 with pups. Because other factors may also influ-
 ence depredation rates (Knowlton et al. 1999), we
 examined the timing and location of depreda-
 tion events, the weight of lambs killed by coyotes,
 the availability of alternate prey, and food avail-
 ability (as measured by a rodent biomass index) in
 coyote territories exhibiting differential kill rates.

 STUDY AREA

 We conducted the project on a 400-km2 study
 area on the Deseret Land and Livestock ranch,

 northeastern Utah. The study area is primarily
 sagebrush (Artimesia tridentata wyomingensis)
 steppe, with an understory of western wheatgrass
 (Pascopyrum smithii), needle-and-thread grass
 (Stipa comata), Indian rice grass (Oryzopsis
 hymenoides), and planted crested wheatgrass

 (Agropyrum desertorum). Average annual rainfall is
 27.6 cm; temperatures range from an average of
 -9.4 C in winter to 15.6oC in summer.

 Coyotes were distributed throughout the study
 area and were relatively unexploited. While sheep
 grazing was a historical use of the area, sheep had
 not grazed the study area recently. Cattle were
 grazed intermittently throughout the area. Win-
 ter carrion in the form of cattle and elk (Cervus
 elaphus) carcasses was plentiful. Mule deer
 (Odocoileus hemionus) and pronghorn antelope
 (Antilocapra americana) were common in the area.
 The most abundant small prey were white-tailed
 jackrabbits (Lepus townsendii), cottontail rabbits
 (Sylvilagus nutalli), Uinta ground squirrels (Sper-
 mophilus armatus), deer mice (Peromyscus manicu-
 latus), and least chipmunks (Tamias minimus).

 METHODS

 During summer 1997, coyotes were trapped
 with #3 padded-jaw, leg-hold traps equipped with
 tranquilizer tabs (Balser 1965, Sahr and Knowl-
 ton 2000) containing propriopromazine. Cap-
 tured coyotes were immobilized with ketamine
 hydrochloride (10 mg/kg) and acepromozine
 (0.1 mg/kg). Coyotes were weighed, sexed, blood
 sampled, and aged by tooth wear (Gier 1968). A
 premolar was extracted and sent to a commercial
 lab (Matson's Laboratory, Milltown, Montana,
 USA) for aging by cementum annuli analysis
 (Linhart and Knowlton 1967). Animals were
 radiocollared with a 150-g transmitter (Advanced
 Telemetry Systems, Isanti, Minnesota, USA) and
 released at the point of capture.

 During December 1997, January 1998, and Jan-
 uary 1999, a hand-held net-gun fired from a heli-
 copter was used to capture coyotes (Barrett et al.
 1982, Gese et al. 1987). Previously radiocollared
 animals were recaptured along with as many pack
 members as possible. Additional packs in the
 study area were also captured. Packs were ran-
 domly assigned to sterile and sham treatments.
 Because identification of alpha breeding coyotes
 is difficult without field observation, members of
 the same pack received the same treatment. Cap-
 tured coyotes were transported by helicopter to a
 local veterinary clinic for surgical sterilization.
 Females were sterilized by tubal ligation and
 males by vasectomy, leaving hormonal systems
 intact (Zemlicka 1995). Animals in the sham
 treatment underwent all procedures except actu-
 al sterilization. All animals were held overnight
 for recovery and observation, then released at the
 point of capture the following morning.

 During 1997 and 1998, coyotes were relocated
 primarily from fixed stations (null-peak) posi-
 tioned around the perimeter of the study area
 (White and Garrott 1990). In 1999, we used
 hand-held triangulation to acquire bearings <10
 min apart with triangulation angles between 200
 and 1600 (Gese et al. 1990). The software pack-
 age LOCATE (Pacer, Truro, Nova Scotia) was
 used to calculate animal locations. We attempted
 to locate all coyotes twice daily (morning and
 evening) during the time sheep were in the study
 area (May through Sep). During the remainder
 of the year, coyotes were located approximately
 every 2 weeks using aerial telemetry (Mech 1983)
 when snow made roads impassable for ground
 relocations. Home ranges were calculated using
 CALHOME (Kie et al. 1996). The adaptive ker-
 nel estimator (Worton 1989) was used to delin-
 eate territory boundaries (90% isopleth) and
 core areas (60% isopleth) of use. To confirm
 breeding status of the pack, searches were made
 by foot and in the air of all coyote territories to
 find dens and confirm the presence or absence
 of pups. Responses to simulated howling were
 also used to determine the presence of pups dur-
 ing summer (Harrington and Mech 1982).

 To assess coyote predation rates on sheep, small
 bands of ewes and lambs were introduced into

 the study area. Because we herded and moni-
 tored the bands daily, we had the ability to sys-
 tematically move the sheep through all the coy-
 ote territories in the study area. In 1997, we
 released 222 ewes and 195 lambs on the ranch in

 mid-June; 10 ewes were radiocollared to assist in
 flock location. This flock served to expose all the
 coyotes in the area to sheep prior to any treat-
 ment. In 1998, we released 138 ewes and 173
 lambs on the study area in early June; we radio-
 collared 50 lambs (29% of the lambs) to aid in
 finding kills. In 1999, we started in mid-May with
 136 ewes and 150 lambs transported to the study
 site. Because finding all the kills in 1998 proved
 difficult, all lambs (n = 150) in 1999 were radio-
 collared. In both 1998 and 1999, the sheep were
 split into 2 flocks to maximize coyote exposure to
 sheep. All flocks were removed from the ranch
 in mid-September of each year. Most lambs were
 about 3 weeks old at the time of release.

 Because lamb age affects vulnerability to coyote
 predation (Andelt 1987, Knowlton et al. 1999),
 we moved the flocks so that each coyote pack was
 exposed to 1 flock early in the season and the
 other flock later in the season. Approximately
 once a month, the sheep were penned, lambs

 weighed, and the radiocollars adjusted as neces-
 sary. The sheep were relocated each day, and
 whenever possible the bed site area was searched
 for kills. Radiocollared lambs with mortality sig-
 nals were located as soon as possible. Death sites
 were searched for tracks, scat, and other sign of
 predator presence. Dead lambs were necropsied,
 and hemorrhaging, bite marks, and other evi-
 dence at the kill site was used to determine the

 cause of death (Rowley 1970, Wade and Bowns
 1985). Kills located in a specific coyote pack ter-
 ritory were attributed to that pack unless evi-
 dence from telemetry suggested otherwise.
 Because the number of days sheep were in coy-

 ote territories varied, the kill rate of sheep in each
 coyote territory was standardized to a 1-week
 interval. A Students t-test was used to compare
 weekly kill rates of sterile and intact packs. To
 account for both flock size and length of time
 spent in each territory (i.e., exposure days), a
 weekly survival rate for the sheep grazed within
 each coyote territory was also calculated (Heisey
 and Fuller 1985). Sheep survival rates were only
 calculated for 1999 when all lambs were radiocol-

 lared. A t-test was used to compare the weekly
 sheep survival rates between intact and sterile coy-
 ote packs. Because coyote pack size could influ-
 ence depredation rates, we performed a regres-
 sion analysis of the number of coyotes in a pack
 versus the number of lambs killed by that pack.

 Small mammal-trapping grids and spotlight sur-
 veys were used to determine numbers and types
 of alternative prey available on the study area.
 Spotlighting transects (Smith and Nydegger
 1985) were conducted from a vehicle traveling at
 10-15 km/hr after dark in mid-June and late
 August. White-tailed jackrabbits and cottontail
 rabbits were counted, and the number of lago-
 morphs observed/km was compared to an exist-
 ing data set for the study area (Rick Danvir,
 Deseret Land and Livestock Co., unpublished
 data). Small mammal-trapping grids were locat-
 ed across 4 habitat types (meadow, sparse vegeta-
 tion, moderately dense sagebrush, and dense
 sagebrush). Two 30.5 x 91.4 m grids of 96 Sher-
 man live traps were established in each habitat
 type and run for 3 consecutive nights. Traps were
 checked each morning; animals were identified,
 marked, and released. The average weight of
 each small mammal species was multiplied by the
 number of small mammals captured per 100
 operable trap-nights to calculate a rodent bio-
 mass index for each habitat type. After we deter-
 mined the amount of each habitat type in each

 coyote territory, an index of available rodent bio-
 mass was then calculated for each territory by
 multiplying the amount of each habitat type in
 the territory by the biomass index for that habitat
 type. A t-test was then used to compare the
 indices of available rodent biomass between

 intact and sterile coyote packs. Home range size
 and habitat analyses were preformed for packs
 with >1 radiocollared coyote.

 RESULTS

 Capture and Surgical Treatments
 Data were collected from June 1997 to Septem-

 ber 1999, with the most intense data collection
 occurring during the summer when sheep were
 present (May-Sep). We captured 11 coyotes (7 M,
 4 F) in 1997. Two sessions of aerial net-gunning
 during winters 1998 and 1999 resulted in the cap-
 ture of an additional 31 (22 M, 9 F) coyotes, plus
 the recapture of 10 of 11 coyotes trapped in 1997.
 Ten males and 9 females were given sham opera-
 tions, while 20 males and 6 females were steril-

 ized. No capture or surgery-related mortalities

 were observed. If the alpha pair was not sterilized
 and pups were observed, the pack was classified
 as an intact pack. In 4 packs, no members were
 captured or radiocollared, but pack members
 were observed and the home range boundary was
 estimated based on the spatial arrangement of
 adjacent radiocollared packs (Fritts and Mech
 1981, Messier 1985, Fuller 1989).

 Coyote Kill Rates
 In 1998, we monitored 5 sterile and 6 intact

 packs (Table 1). Sheep spent an average of 16.5 days
 in each coyote territory. The 5 sterile packs were
 responsible for 1 kill, and the average number of
 kills per week by all sterile packs was 0.07 (? 0.16
 SD). The 6 intact packs killed 11 lambs, for a
 weekly average of 0.77 ? 0.92 (t = 1.63, df = 9, P=
 0.068). The observed frequency of kills between
 the 2 treatments (sterile vs. intact) was different
 than expected (X2 = 6.656, df = 1, P= 0.0099), with
 intact packs killing more lambs (11 kills observed,
 6.55 expected) and sterile packs killing fewer
 lambs (1 kill observed, 5.45 expected) than expect-
 ed. A regression analysis of coyote pack size versus

 the weekly kill rate on sheep revealed no signifi-
 cant relationship (12 = 0.008, F= 0.078, P= 0.786).
 Of the 11 coyote packs monitored in 1998, 4 ster-

 ile and 3 intact packs did not kill sheep. When only
 the sheep-killing coyote packs were considered,
 the sterile pack killed 0.35 lambs/week. The 3 in-
 tact packs killed an average of 1.53 lambs/week.
 Thus, among coyote packs that killed sheep, there
 were 4.4 times more lambs killed/week by intact
 coyote packs than by sterile packs.

 In 1999, we monitored 4 sterile and 8 intact

 packs (Table 1). Sheep spent an average of 16.6
 days in each territory. Sterile packs killed 3
 lambs, for an average of 0.29 kills/week (? 0.20
 SD), while intact packs killed 22 sheep, for an
 average of 1.48 kills/week (? 2.09; t = 1.167, df =
 10, P= 0.147). However, intact packs killed more
 lambs and sterile packs killed fewer lambs than
 expected (X2 = 5.114, df = 1, P= 0.0237). There
 was no relationship between coyote pack size and
 the weekly kill rate for each pack in 1999 (r2 =
 0.08, F= 0.87, P= 0.37).
 Of the 12 coyote packs monitored in 1999, 1

 sterile pack and 4 intact packs did not kill sheep.
 Among sheep-killing packs, the average number
 of sheep killed per week was lower (0.38 ? 0.07)
 for sterile packs than for intact packs (2.95 ? 2.10
 kills/wk; t = 2.0677, df = 5, P = 0.0468). Among
 coyote packs that killed sheep, intact packs were
 7.8 times more likely to kill sheep than were ster-
 ile packs. Combining both years, intact coyote
 packs (i = 2.34 ? 1.70 kills/wk) killed 6 times
 more sheep than sterile packs (F = 0.38 ? 0.06
 kills/wk; t = 2.23, df = 9, P= 0.0261).
 When sheep survival rates were compared

 between sham and sterile packs, the weekly sur-
 vival rate tended to be higher for sheep in sterile
 coyote territories (? = 0.998) than in intact coyote
 territories (? = 0.989). Among sheep-killing packs,
 the weekly sheep survival rate was higher in sterile
 coyote packs (X = 0.997 ? 0.00) than in intact packs
 (? = 0.985 ? 0.016; t = 2.01, df = 5, P= 0.05).

 Characteristics of Kills

 During 1999, coyotes killed 25 lambs. Seven
 additional lambs died of causes not related to

 coyote predation: drowning (1), pneumonia (2),
 and unknown causes (4). Coyotes completely
 consumed 13 of the sheep killed, partially con-
 sumed 6 kills, and left 3 kills intact. No con-

 sumption data were available for 3 kills. Coyotes
 tended to kill lambs from the lightest weight
 quartile (x2 = 10.15, P < 0.01) more frequently
 than lambs from the heavier quartiles (Fig. 1),

 but they were capable of killing even the heaviest
 lambs. Lambs were classed into weight quartiles
 by comparing their last live weight to the rest of
 the lambs in the herd. Thus, the weight of lambs
 in the lightest quartile increased over the grazing
 season, and coyotes were selecting mostly the
 lightest lambs available. Lambs that strayed or
 had been located apart from the main flock on
 the previous day were more likely to be killed
 than those remaining with the flock.

 Location and Timing of Kills

 In 1998, coyotes killed 3 sheep in the core and 4
 sheep on the edge of their territories. Based on a
 comparison of sheep locations and kill locations,
 the distribution of kills was not different from

 expected (X2 = 0.234, P= 0.62). In 1999, there was
 a slight difference (X2 = 3.01, P = 0.08) between
 the distribution of kills observed in the core (n =
 3), and on the edge (n = 16) of territories, and the
 expected distribution of kills. This is true even
 though the analysis accounted for the amount of
 time sheep spent on the edge and in the core.
 We found no evidence of coyotes following sheep
 outside their territory. However, many kills were
 located in areas of overlap between territories,
 and 1 kill that was just inside the 60% isopleth was
 assigned to the neighboring pack because, based
 on radiotelemetry locations, the residents were
 not in that area on the night of the kill.

 Kill rates of sheep by coyotes increased over the
 summer, particularly among intact coyote packs
 (Fig. 2). Sterile packs that killed sheep did so at
 a relatively constant rate. The increase in kill rate
 among intact coyote packs is likely due to the

 increasing energy demand of growing pups. A
 reduction in alternate prey (ground squirrels
 enter hibernation in late Aug) was also consid-
 ered as a possibility for increased killing, but did
 not explain the lack of increased killing among
 the sterile packs.

 Influence of Alternative Prey on Predation
 Rates

 White-tailed jackrabbit numbers were well below
 their 1991 peak (Rick Danvir, Deseret Land and
 Livestock Co., unpublished data), but increased
 during the study. The lagomorph spotlight index
 increased from 0.29 rabbits/km in 1997 to 1.25

 rabbits/km in 1999. Small mammal-trapping
 grids yielded 0 to 0.063 animals/trap night, with
 no significant difference (all paired comparisons
 had P > 0.10) in the number of animals captured
 between any of the years. Increasing lagomorph
 numbers did not appear to influence coyote pre-
 dation rates on sheep. The increase in sheep kills
 from 1998 to 1999 was probably due to our in-
 creased ability to find and recover kills because
 all lambs were radiocollared in 1999.

 Influence of Available Rodent Biomass on
 Predation Rates

 We found no significant difference in the
 indices of available rodent biomass between ster-

 ile coyote packs (8,766 ? 1,552) and intact packs
 (7,930 ? 1,752; t = --0.75, df = 10, P = 0.48). Thus,

 differences in kill rates between sterile and intact

 packs were not in response to differential prey
 biomass in the territories. Similarly, regression
 analysis indicated no relationship between the
 weekly kill rate on sheep and the rodent biomass
 index in each territory (r2 = 0.06, F= 4.34, P= 0.53).

 Costs and Benefits of Sterilization

 We estimated the cost to surgically sterilize a
 coyote was $560/animal (helicopter flight time:
 $300, surgery: $75, transport: $60, fixed-wing fly-
 ing: $60, personnel: $55, supplies: $10). On aver-
 age we captured and sterilized 3 coyotes/pack;
 thus, the cost of sterilizing a coyote pack was
 $1,680. Sterile coyote packs killed an average of
 0.38 lambs/week, while intact packs killed on
 average 2.34 lambs/week. Since sterilization did
 not necessarily stop predation, we used the dif-
 ference between the 2 treatments as the amount

 of loss averted (1.96 lambs killed/wk). We used
 the kill rates of sheep-killing packs only because
 non-killing packs would require no management
 action. Using this difference in averted losses, we
 calculated that over a summer grazing season (16
 wks) approximately 32 lambs would not be killed.
 With a market value of $56/lamb ($0.70 per
 pound x 80 pound lamb), we estimated that
 $1,792 of lambs was the amount of losses averted
 in 1 4-month grazing season. Thus, if a small-
 scale livestock operation was affected by 1 coyote
 pack during the summer, then the cost to surgi-
 cally sterilize them would equal the amount of
 lambs saved in the first year. Considering the life
 span of coyotes and length of pair-bonds, surgi-
 cally sterilizing coyote packs on a small scale
 could be economically feasible if the sterilized
 coyotes are allowed to survive (i.e., if the coyotes
 are killed, then the costs to sterilize begin again).

 DISCUSSION

 Animals producing offspring may maximize
 their hunting efficiency by preying on larger prey
 (Royama 1970, Harrison and Harrison 1984). In
 addition, transport costs of delivering a larger
 prey item to the young may also be more prof-
 itable than small-sized prey (Till and Knowlton
 1983), at the same time providing for increased
 energetic requirements of a growing litter. Our
 data indicate that coyotes change their predatory
 tendencies when pups are present and that steril-
 ization could be an effective method of reducing
 coyote predation on domestic sheep in the Inter-
 mountain West. None of the sterile coyote packs
 killed more than 1 lamb per season, while intact

 packs had multiple killing events. Among coyote
 packs that killed sheep, the rate of predation on
 sheep was significantly lower for packs that were
 not provisioning pups.
 For this technique to be successful, the breed-

 ing pair must be sterilized. In 1999, 1 of the
 packs that was originally believed to be sterile
 killed 5 lambs. No pups were seen in the area
 during initial searches from the air or on foot.
 However, further investigation showed the breed-
 ing pair had not been captured and sterilized,
 resulting in at least 2 pups being produced. This
 observation underscores the need to sterilize at

 least 1 and preferably both members of the
 breeding pair to prevent pup production.
 This study presents further evidence that not all

 coyotes kill sheep (Sacks et al. 1999). In some
 areas where pups were present, no lambs were
 killed by some coyote packs even after 3 years of
 exposure to sheep. These coyote territories rep-
 resent situations in which no control measures

 should be undertaken. The pressure for the
 adults to provision their pups is only 1 factor driv-
 ing predation on sheep. Characteristics of indi-
 vidual packs and territories may also be critical in
 determining which coyotes kill sheep. Further
 investigation into the sheep-killing tendencies of
 pups from packs that killed and ate sheep versus
 pups from packs that seemed to ignore sheep
 may be useful.
 Alternate prey availability may influence coyote

 predation rates on native prey (Hoffman 1979,
 Hamlin et al. 1984) and domestic sheep
 (McAdoo 1975, Guthery 1977, Kauffeld 1977,
 Gober 1979). Deer fawn (0. virginianus) avail-
 ability, as regulated by winter severity, affected
 the rate at which wolves killed livestock in Min-

 nesota (Mech et al. 1988). Hamlin et al. (1984)
 suggested that coyote predation on deer fawns
 was lowest during summers when microtine
 rodent numbers were highest. Our study
 occurred during years when the abundance of
 lagomorphs and ground squirrels was fairly typi-
 cal for the region. We found that indices of avail-
 able rodent biomass did not affect the number of

 lambs killed in each territory. Similarly, lago-
 morph abundance did not appear to influence
 annual coyote predation rates on sheep. In addi-
 tion, coyotes had access to antelope and deer
 fawns, but it was unknown whether coyotes pre-
 ferred fawns over sheep, or if sterile coyotes
 killed fewer fawns similarly to killing fewer lambs.
 We documented 1 trespass kill, just inside the

 neighbors' core area (60% isopleth), but trespass

 killing seemed to be a rare occurrence. Unlike
 Shivik et al. (1996), we did not observe an in-
 crease in core area overlap between adjacent
 pack territories when sheep were present, nor
 did we record coyotes following sheep into neigh-
 bors' territory. We did document a higher rate of
 kills on the edges of territories than expected by
 chance, so sheep in an area of territory overlap
 (at the 95% isopleths) could be accessible to
 more than 1 pack.
 Most of the lambs killed were consumed-

 implying that they were being used as a food
 source-though unconsumed kills were located
 in both sterile and intact coyote territories. We
 had insufficient data to determine litter size of

 coyotes, but further research focusing on the
 relationship between the number of pups and
 predation rates on lambs should be considered.
 The timing of kills, with increasing kills by intact
 packs over the summer and into early fall has
 been documented (Klebenow and McAdoo 1976,
 Tigner and Larson 1977, Boggess et al. 1980).
 This increase in predation likely reflects in-
 creased energy demand of growing pups (Ofte-
 dal and Gittleman 1989). Reduced alternate prey
 levels (i.e., ground squirrels going into hiberna-
 tion) were also considered. However, sterile coy-
 ote packs did not increase their predation rate on
 sheep similarly to the intact packs when ground
 squirrels entered hibernation in mid-August.
 Learning and development of hunting behavior
 of pups (Till and Knowlton 1983) could also be a
 possibility, but seemed unlikely at that time of
 year (i.e., the pups would be <4 months old in
 mid-Aug).
 Among the large social carnivores, hunting is a

 cooperative activity that usually involves several
 group members (e.g., wolves: Mech 1966, 1970;
 Peterson 1977; Carbyn et al. 1993). However,
 Thurber and Peterson (1993) observed single
 wolves capable of killing moose (Alces alces) on Isle
 Royale. We found that the size of the coyote pack
 had no effect on the weekly kill rate on lambs.
 Lambs can be killed by a single coyote (Wade and
 Bowns 1985), and since most kills on sheep are
 usually attributed to the breeding pair (Sacks et al.
 1999), additional pack members do not seem to
 increase the rate of depredation on sheep. For
 native ungulates, cooperative hunting by coyotes
 may facilitate capture of larger prey, but it is not
 always necessary (Gese and Grothe 1995).
 The coyotes followed in this study did not kill

 adult sheep. Two ewes were attacked and bitten
 on the neck, but both survived the attacks. The

 largest lamb killed by coyotes weighed 44 kg and
 was larger than some of the ewes in the flock. It
 may be that coyotes would have killed ewes if
 exposure was continued, especially if ewes were
 present without lambs. Our research differs from
 studies conducted in north-coastal California

 (Conner et al. 1998, Sacks et al. 1999), because in
 our study area (and in much of the Intermoun-
 tain West) lambs were only available seasonally.
 Adult sheep are available on a year-round basis,
 and lambs are available over 9 months in north-

 coastal California (Conner et al. 1998, Sacks et al.
 1999). In the Intermountain West, the birth of
 lambs occurs later than in north-coastal Califor-

 nia and generally corresponds with the coyote
 pup-rearing season. Therefore, sterilization may
 not have as great an effect in modifying coyote
 predation behavior in areas where lambs are con-
 sidered a year-round prey item.

 MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS

 We designed this experiment to test whether
 surgical sterilization can change the predatory
 tendencies of coyotes and whether the procedure
 will reduce (but not completely stop) predation
 on domestic lambs. A more efficient method of

 fertility control would likely be needed for appli-
 cation as a viable management tool on a larger
 scale. Sterile coyotes maintained territories and
 pair bonds in a manner similar to non-sterile coy-
 otes (Bromley 2000). In areas where long-term
 removal has had a limited effect on reducing pre-
 dation (Conner et al. 1998), a pair of sterile coy-
 otes occupying a territory--that are not killing
 sheep or killing at very low rates-could serve as
 an effective deterrent to other coyotes. Our tech-
 nique of capture and surgical sterilization may be
 cost-effective. Till (1982) estimated that it costs
 $208 to locate and remove 1 den of pups. Wagn-
 er and Conover (1999) estimated that it costs
 about $185 to kill a coyote from a fixed-wing air-
 craft and about $805 to trap a coyote on the
 ground. However, trapping, denning, and aerial
 gunning all require annual reapplication of those
 techniques, while sterilization can be effective for
 as long as the coyotes survive (or continue as
 alpha animals). A comparison of costs versus
 benefits showed that on a small-scale livestock

 operation (i.e., an operation being affected by
 only 1 pack of coyotes), the cost of surgically ster-
 ilizing 1 coyote pack was recovered by the
 amount of losses averted within the same year. As
 alternative methods of delivering sterilants are
 developed (DeLiberto et al. 1998), sterilization

 may prove an efficient solution for changing the
 predatory behavior of coyotes on a larger scale.
 Sterilization could also be valuable in areas where

 lethal control is socially unacceptable (Mech et
 al. 1996) and where enhancement of fawn
 recruitment rates of native ungulates is a man-
 agement objective.
