 Abstract: Predation by coyotes (Canis latrans) on domestic sheep is a problem for many livestock producers through-

 out the United States Intermountain West. We examined whether surgical sterilization of coyote packs would mod-

 ify their predatory behavior and reduce predation rates on domestic sheep as compared to coyote packs with pups.

 FromJune 1997 to December 1997, we gathered baseline information on coyote pack size and movements. In win-

 ter 1998, we surgically sterilized and radiocollared members of 5 coyote packs. We also captured and radiocollared

 members of 6 packs that remained intact (i.e., reproductive). During summer 1998, only 1 sterile pack killed a lamb,

 while 3 intact packs killed 11 lambs. When only sheep-killing packs were included, sterile packs killed an average of

 0.35 lambs/week, while intact packs killed 1.53 lambs/week in 1998. During winter 1999, we monitored 4 sterile and

 (Garrott 1995). Most efforts have focused on

 developing and testing various contraceptive sub-
 stances (Elder 1964, Stellfug et al. 1978, Millar et

 al. 1989) or methods of drug administration

 (Matschke 1977, Plotka and Seal 1989, Kirk-

 patrick et al. 1990). Computer models that illus-

 trate the potential of canid fertility control have

 been developed (Haight and Mech 1997, Pech et

 al. 1997). Research designed to evaluate the

 potential of canid fertility control has document-

 ed changes in reproduction (Balser 1964) as well
 as behavioral responses to sterilization (Mech et

 al. 1996, Saunders and McIlroy 1996, Bubela

 1999). However, no studies have addressed the

 effect of sterilization on depredation behavior.

 Till and Knowlton (1983) showed that predation

 on domestic lambs by adult coyotes stopped when

 their pups were removed. They theorized that

 sterilizing territorial coyotes could be more effec-

 tive than removing the pups of depredating adults

 because (1) no lamb loss would occur before the

 pups were removed; (2) the sterilized coyotes

 may keep out other reproductive coyotes that

 During 1997 and 1998, coyotes were relocated
 primarily from fixed stations (null-peak) posi-
 tioned around the perimeter of the study area

 (White and Garrott 1990). In 1999, we used

 hand-held triangulation to acquire bearings <10

 min apart with triangulation angles between 200

 and 1600 (Gese et al. 1990). The software pack-

 age LOCATE (Pacer, Truro, Nova Scotia) was

 used to calculate animal locations. We attempted

 to locate all coyotes twice daily (morning and

 increasing energy demand of growing pups. A

 reduction in alternate prey (ground squirrels

 enter hibernation in late Aug) was also consid-

 ered as a possibility for increased killing, but did

 not explain the lack of increased killing among

 the sterile packs.

 Influence of Alternative Prey on Predation

 Rates

 White-tailed jackrabbit numbers were well below

 their 1991 peak (Rick Danvir, Deseret Land and
 Livestock Co., unpublished data), but increased

 during the study. The lagomorph spotlight index

 increased from 0.29 rabbits/km in 1997 to 1.25

 rabbits/km in 1999. Small mammal-trapping

 grids yielded 0 to 0.063 animals/trap night, with

 no significant difference (all paired comparisons
 had P > 0.10) in the number of animals captured
 between any of the years. Increasing lagomorph

 numbers did not appear to influence coyote pre-

 dation rates on sheep. The increase in sheep kills

 from 1998 to 1999 was probably due to our in-

 creased ability to find and recover kills because

 all lambs were radiocollared in 1999.

 Influence of Available Rodent Biomass on

 Predation Rates

 We found no significant difference in the

 indices of available rodent biomass between ster-

 ile coyote packs (8,766 ? 1,552) and intact packs

 (7,930 ? 1,752; t = --0.75, df = 10, P = 0.48). Thus,

 516 COYOTE STERILIZATION * Bromley and Gese J. Wildl. Manage. 65(3):2001

 packs had multiple killing events. Among coyote
 packs that killed sheep, the rate of predation on

 sheep was significantly lower for packs that were

 not provisioning pups.

 For this technique to be successful, the breed-

 ing pair must be sterilized. In 1999, 1 of the

 packs that was originally believed to be sterile

 killed 5 lambs. No pups were seen in the area

 during initial searches from the air or on foot.

 However, further investigation showed the breed-

 ing pair had not been captured and sterilized,

 resulting in at least 2 pups being produced. This

 observation underscores the need to sterilize at

 least 1 and preferably both members of the

 breeding pair to prevent pup production.

 This study presents further evidence that not all

 coyotes kill sheep (Sacks et al. 1999). In some

 areas where pups were present, no lambs were

 killed by some coyote packs even after 3 years of

 exposure to sheep. These coyote territories rep-

 resent situations in which no control measures

 should be undertaken. The pressure for the

 adults to provision their pups is only 1 factor driv-

 ing predation on sheep. Characteristics of indi-

 vidual packs and territories may also be critical in

 determining which coyotes kill sheep. Further

 investigation into the sheep-killing tendencies of
 pups from packs that killed and ate sheep versus

 pups from packs that seemed to ignore sheep

 may be useful.

 Alternate prey availability may influence coyote

 predation rates on native prey (Hoffman 1979,

 Hamlin et al. 1984) and domestic sheep

 (McAdoo 1975, Guthery 1977, Kauffeld 1977,
 Gober 1979). Deer fawn (0. virginianus) avail-

 ability, as regulated by winter severity, affected

 the rate at which wolves killed livestock in Min-

 nesota (Mech et al. 1988). Hamlin et al. (1984)

 suggested that coyote predation on deer fawns
 was lowest during summers when microtine

 largest lamb killed by coyotes weighed 44 kg and
 was larger than some of the ewes in the flock. It

 may be that coyotes would have killed ewes if

 exposure was continued, especially if ewes were

 present without lambs. Our research differs from

 studies conducted in north-coastal California

 (Conner et al. 1998, Sacks et al. 1999), because in

 our study area (and in much of the Intermoun-

 tain West) lambs were only available seasonally.
 Adult sheep are available on a year-round basis,

 and lambs are available over 9 months in north-

 coastal California (Conner et al. 1998, Sacks et al.

 1999). In the Intermountain West, the birth of

 lambs occurs later than in north-coastal Califor-

 nia and generally corresponds with the coyote
