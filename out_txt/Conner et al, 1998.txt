Abstract: We used 13 years of historical data to investigate effects of coyote (Canis latrans) removal on 
depredation of domestic sheep. The 2,168-ha study area maintained >1,000 breeding ewes that produced 
lambs yearly. Records from 1981 through 1994, which included numbers of sheep, numbers of sheep known 
killed by coyotes, known numbers of coyotes removed, and annual numbers of trapper hours were summarized 
and analyzed on a yearly, seasonal, and monthly basis. We used regression analysis and found that annual, 
seasonal, or monthly depredation losses were not correlated with number of coyotes removed. Both annual 
number of lambs killed and number of coyotes removed were positively correlated with number of trapper 
hours. We used a cross-correlation analysis to detect any relation between coyote removal and subsequent 
depredation losses at all monthly intervals from 0 to 24 months. We found a trend of low negative correlation 
between depredation losses and number of coyotes removed for lags of 2-12 months, suggesting some reduction 
of sheep killing due to control efforts. Low correlations within years may be due to inconsistent removal of 
depredating coyotes while removing primarily young, nondepredating coyotes. Lack of correlation between 
years may have occurred because past control efforts have not had a lasting reduction on coyote density due 
to immigration, the compensatory nature of control efforts on coyote mortality, reproductive compensation in 
the resident coyote population, or all 3 factors.

Coyote predation on domestic sheep remains 
a chronic problem in the western United States. 
A principal control strategy is perennial removal 
of coyotes 
from 
livestock operations 
(Andelt 
1996). This local population reduction 
is selec- 
tive with respect to the damage site but not nec- 
essarily selective 
to particular coyotes 
that kill 
sheep 
(Connolly 1978). Studies have been con- 
ducted on coyote predation at sheep operations 
in the presence and absence of removal (Kle- 
benow and McAdoo 1976, Henne 
1977, Nass 
1977, Tigner and Larson 1977, McAdoo and 
Klebenow 1978). However, variation in annual 
predation rates between studies and variation in 
types and 
intensities of predator control pro- 
duced inconclusive results (U.S. Department of 
the Interior 1978, Pearson 1986). Also, because

of the cost of direct field studies, only a small 
fraction of the sheep industry has been studied. 
Of 18 of the large coyote-sheep 
predation stud- 
ies compiled by the U.S. Department of the In- 
terior (1978) for their comprehensive review of 
in 
the West, 10 were 
field 
predator damage 
studies and 8 were questionnaire 
studies. Du- 
ration of the field studies was short: 1 field study 
was >5 
years, while 
the remaining 7 studies 
were 
-3 
years in duration. Also, the 8 ques- 
tionnaire studies may be biased by overestimat- 
ing 
losses 
to ensure 
federal aid for predator 
control (U.S. Department of the Interior 1978, 
Pearson 1986), making the effectiveness of con- 
trol efforts difficult to evaluate. 
This 
study was done on 
the Hopland Re- 
search and Extension Center (HREC), a sheep 
ranch in northern California where coyote dep- 
redation has been chronic (Scrivner et al. 1985, 
Timm 1990). The HREC offers a unique op- 
portunity 
for 
study of 
coyote 
predation 
on 
sheep because 
(1) the dataset on coyote-killed 
sheep and coyote removals extends over a long 
period of time (13 yr); (2) daily records of coy-

ote-killed sheep and coyote removals were kept 
for 13 years, allowing analyses of predation 
within and between years; (3) sheep were man- 
aged by university employees, which made re- 
cords of coyote-killed sheep more accurate and 
unbiased; and (4) the HREC is similar to many 
sheep operations in the West, where over half 
of 
the 
feed 
supplied 
for commercial 
sheep 
comes 
from private land (U.S. Department of 
the Interior 1978), typically in pasture grazing. 
To add to the body of information on effective- 
ness of coyote control, we focus our analysis on 
long-term patterns of sheep depredation with 
respect to coyote removal efforts at 3 different 
time scales: yearly, seasonally, and monthly. 

STUDY AREA 

The University of California's HREC 
is a 
sheep 
research 
facility 
located 
in Mendocino 
County, California. Elevations ranged from 150 
to 915 m. The HREC 
experienced 
a typical 
Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers, 
and mild, rainy winters. Average annual precip- 
itation was 92 cm; summer rainfall was rare. Av- 
erage temperatures ranged from 80C in winter 
to 210C in summer. The vegetation of HREC 
was a mosaic 
of 4 habitat 
types: grassland 
(27%), woodland-grass 
(33%), dense woodland 
(20%), and chaparral (19%; Murphy and Heady 
1983). Common 
grassland species were wild 
oats 
(Avena barbata), 
ripgutt 
(Bromus dian- 
drus), and 
foxtail (Festuca megalura). Wood- 
land-grass patches were dominated by blue oak 
(Quercus douglasii), valley oak (Q. lobata), and 
interior live oak (Q. wislizenii); dense woodland 
was dominated by black oak (Q. kelloggii), ma- 
drone 
(Arbutus menziesii), and California bay 
(Umbellularia californica). Chaparral occurred 
mainly above 610 m and included chamise (Ad- 
enostoma fasciculatum), 
ceanothus 
(Ceanothus 
cuneatus), manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.), and 

scrub oak (Q. durata). 

The HREC maintained 900-1,500 
ewes dis- 
persed among 32 fenced pastures averaging 80 
ha each. Sheep were rotated among pastures 
according to range quality and research needs. 
Typically, 8-12 of the pastures contained sheep 
at any time. Shepherds did not stay with the 
sheep 
in 
the pastures but 
checked 
pastures 
weekly. Between 
700 and 1,300 
lambs were 
born during 2 seasons between mid-November 
and March. Lambs were born in a main barn 

and held for at least 48 hr prior to placement 
in pastures. 

Average 
annual 
predation 
rates 
of 
ewes 
(2.0%) and lambs (3.1%) at HREC were similar 
to those experienced 
in many operations in the 
West 
(U.S. Department 
of the Interior 1978, 
Pearson 1986). Coyote density over the entire 
study period is unknown. However, density es- 
timates for the 21.68-km2 study area, from pre- 
and postwhelping during 1994-95, were 0.59 
coyotes/km2 (95% CI = 0.41-0.95) 
for coyotes 
>5 months old, and 0.76 coyotes/km2 (96% CI 
= 
0.50-1.41) 
for coyotes 
of all ages 
(Sacks 
1996). Trapping, snaring, and, more recently, 
M-44s have been 
the primary coyote removal 
methods, but shooting and denning 
(Till and 
Knowlton 1983) also have been used. Coyote 
removal at HREC was similar to other western 
sheep 
operations 
(Gee 
et al. 1977, U.S. De- 
partment 
of 
the 
Interior 
1978), 
particularly 
those in northcentral California. The HREC has 
records of sheep availability, sheep distribution, 
and dates and locations of predator kills from 
1981 to 1994. Additionally, U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health 
Inspec- 
tion Service, Wildlife Services program 
(WS; 
formally known as Animal Damage Control or 
ADC) 
records of coyote removals and annual 
trapper hours worked on HREC were available 
for the same period. 

METHODS 

We summarized 13 years of historical data 
from the HREC from 1981 to 1994 (1986 data 
were missing). Records were kept on a monthly 
basis and included number, age classification, 
and sex of sheep in each pasture, as well as age 
and sex of all coyote-killed 
sheep. Coyote kills 
typically identified by hemorrhaging un- 
were 
der the 
skin at the 
throat (Wade and Bowns 
1985). The daily pattern of pasture searching 
was 
consistent 
from 
year-to-year, 
although 
search effort may have been 
less during 1991- 
92. Within years, pastures with sheep were vis- 
ited most days, but pastures with 
lambs were 
searched more often. Numbers of coyote-killed 
sheep did not include the sheep missing in each 
pasture, because this number was not accurate- 
ly recorded on a monthly basis. The same shep- 
herd worked on the station from 1981 to 1994; 
search effort and recording of missing 
hence, 
animals were relatively consistent from year-to- 
(J. Hays, HREC, 
communica- 
year 
personal 
tion). Annual records of missing 
lambs were 
available for 1977-79 and 1990-94. We exclud- 
lambs from predation analyses be- 

ed missing

cause missing 
lambs were 
only 
recorded 
at 
weaning 
and sale, 
there was no relation be- 
tween annual numbers of missing 
lambs and 
number of lambs killed or number of coyotes 
removed, and causes of missing sheep could not 
be determined 
(e.g., whether due 
to coyote, 
mountain lion [Felis concolor], black bear [Urus 
americanus], golden eagle 
[Aquila chrysaetos], 
disease, exposure, miscounts, etc.). 
We also used WS records of date and number 
of coyotes 'removed and of annual trapper hours 
from September 
1981 
through August 1994. 
Annual number of coyotes removed by the WS 
represents a minimum because HREC person- 
nel, neighbors, and seasonal hunters occasion- 
ally removed coyotes (typically by shooting), but 
these 
efforts were 
random and 
independent 
with 
to efforts of control personnel. 
respect 
Coyote pups were not included in the analyses. 
Thus, 
the population of interest was the total 
number of sheep killed by coyotes and the total 
number of coyotes removed by WS personnel 
on HREC. All analyses in this study were done 
on a sample; that is, known coyote-killed sheep 
and known coyote removals are a sample of the 
total number killed and total number removed. 
losses were represented by the 
Depredation 
known number of 
lambs or ewes killed, and 
lamb or ewe kill rates. Kill rates were the pro- 
portion of lambs and ewes killed per month or 
year, per number of 
lambs or ewes available. 
Lambs were present on HREC from November 
through mid-May, and only the months of this 
period were used 
in analyses involving lambs. 
To avoid confounding patterns of ewe and lamb 
killing, only months when 
lambs were absent 
were 
used 
in 
(May-Oct) 
analyses 
involving 
ewes. Removal of coyotes, which 
could 
take 
place during any month of the year, was re- 
gressed against only months when 
lambs were 
present. The HREC 
retained relatively small 
numbers of older 
lambs as replacements, and 
these were lambs were counted as ewes, begin- 
ning in May. 
We examined annual patterns of predation 
through relations between 
the known number 
and rate of sheep killed, known number of coy- 
otes removed, 
total number of trapper hours 
spent on HREC, and number of missing sheep. 
We determined 
effects of coyote 
removal on 
depredation losses by regressing annual number 
of lambs and ewes killed and kill rates against 
number of coyotes removed, with the null hy- 
pothesis 
that depredation 
losses were not cor- 

related with the number of coyotes removed on 
a yearly basis. We regressed annual number of 
lambs and ewes killed and kill rates against an- 
nual 
trapper hours 
to evaluate 
if control on 
HREC, 
at least annually, was preventative or 
corrective. The null hypothesis was that number 
of kills or kill rates were not related to trapping 
effort. We regressed annual number of coyotes 
removed against annual trapper hours to eval- 
uate if numbers removed were related to effort 
and not to changes in coyote population densi- 
ties. The null hypothesis was that trapping ef- 
fort was not related to number of coyotes re- 
moved. Lastly, we regressed annual number of 
total kills (ewes plus lambs) against annual num- 
ber of missing 
to evaluate 
if missing 
sheep 
could be confounding 
the relation be- 
sheep 
tween number of kills and number of coyote 
removals. The null hypothesis was that number 
of kills was not related to number of missing 
sheep. 
We examined monthly patterns of predation 
by regressing number of lambs and ewes killed 
and kill rate against number 
of coyotes 
re- 
moved. The null hypothesis was that depreda- 
tion losses were not related to the number of 
coyotes removed on a monthly basis. However, 
correlations between 
the number of lambs and 
ewes killed, or kill rate, and the number of coy- 
otes removed could occur at intervals different 
than 1 month or year. For example, removing 3 
coyotes 
in 1 month might not decrease 
the 
number of lambs and ewes killed until the fol- 
lowing month, or the following year. Therefore, 
we 
used 
a cross-correlation 
analysis 
(Diggle 
1990) to detect correlations at all monthly in- 
tervals from 0 to 24 months. Negative correla- 
tions between 
coyote depredation 
losses and 
number of coyotes removed would suggest that 
coyote 
removal was decreasing 
future depre- 
dation. Positive correlations may indicate a dis- 
in existing coyote 
ruption 
territories, whereby 
more coyotes have access 
to sheep, which re- 
sults in increased depredation. The null hypoth- 
esis was that depredation 
losses were not relat- 
ed to number of coyotes previously removed for 
lags of 0-24 months. 
Seasonal analyses were conducted by parti- 
tioning 
time 
to examine 
the 
effects 
of 
lamb 
presence. Because 
coyote predation on sheep 
may be related to timing of lamb and sheep use 
and not related 
to calendar months, we per- 
formed an analysis based on seasonal changes 
in sheep production: 
lambing I = November,

December, and January; lambing 2 = February, 
March, and April; ewes 
1 = May, June, and 
July; and ewes 2 = August, September, and Oc- 
tober. Both number of kills and number of coy- 
otes removed were grouped by these 
seasons. 
We regressed 
seasonal number of 
lambs and 
ewes killed and kill against number of coyotes 
removed. Because removal may reduce subse- 
quent killing, numbers of coyotes removed were 
regressed at lags of 1-4 
seasons. The null hy- 
pothesis was that depredation 
losses were not 
related to the number of coyotes removed on a 
seasonal basis. 
Statistical analyses of the historical data were 
post hoc. We used a = 0.05 in all analyses. Pow- 
er analyses on the correlation coefficients were 
based on a 1-sided alternative hypothesis 
(i.e., 
Ho: p = 0 vs. HI: p < 0). The relations between 
coyote removal and kill rates cannot be consid- 
ered causal because of the observational nature 
of this study. We verified assumptions of nor- 

mality, equal variance, and linearity of residuals 
for all regression analyses (Ott 1993). 

RESULTS 

Annual lamb and ewe kills and kill rates were 
not correlated with the number of coyotes re- 
(P > 0.05; Figs. 1A-D). There was a 
moved 
positive correlation between number of lambs 
killed per year and number of trapper hours 
worked on HREC per year (r12 = 0.68, P = 
0.015), but lamb kill rate was not correlated to 
trapper hours (r12 = 0.50, P = 0.095, 1 - P = 
0.64). There was also a positive correlation be- 
tween number of coyotes removed per year and 
number of trapper hours worked on HREC per 
year (r12 = 0.75, P = 0.003). Neither number 
of ewes killed nor ewe kill rate was correlated 
with number of trapper hours on an annual ba- 
sis (ewes killed: r12 = 0.20, P = 0.530, 1 - 
= 
0.19; kill rate: r12 = 0.14, P = 0.658, 1 - P =

dicated an effect size of r = 0.76 was needed 
to 
ensure 
90% power 
for annual regression 
analyses. Annual mean number of coyotes re- 
moved was 10.8 
(SE = 1.6, n = 13). Annual 
mean number of missing sheep was 177 (SE = 
8.9, n = 8), which was an average of 11.8% (SE 
= 0.5, n = 8) of the HREC flock. Annual num- 
ber of missing sheep was not correlated with 
annual number of kills (r7 = 0.55, P = 0.205, 1 
- p1 = 0.49). 
Plots of mean monthly sheep kills and coyo- 
tes 
removed 
showed 
highest 
lamb kills and 
lamb kill rates occurred during January through 
April, while ewe kills and kill rates were highest 
(Figs. 2A,B). 
during July through September 
Coyote removals occurred over the entire year, 
with peaks in February, April, and September 
(Figs. 2A,B). Neither monthly number of lambs 
killed nor 
lamb kill rate was correlated with 
number of coyotes removed 
(lambs killed: r71 
= 0.19, P = 0.117, 1 - 
1 = 0.47; kill rate: r71 
= 0.20, P = 0.093, 1 - 
13 = 0.51). Similarly, 
neither monthly number of ewes killed nor ewe 

13 = 

kill rate was correlated with number of coyotes 
removed 
(ewes killed: r71 = 0.16, P = 0.196, 1 
- 13 = 0.48; kill rate r71 = 0.22, P = 0.071, 1 
- 
0.56). Post hoc power analyses 
(Zar 
1984) indicated an effect size of r = 0.37 was 
needed 
to ensure 90% power for monthly re- 
gression analyses. 
Monthly effects of coyote removal on num- 
ber of lambs and ewes subsequently killed and 
proportion 
of 
lambs and 
ewes 
subsequently 
via 
cross-correlation 
killed were 
determined 
for 
lags of 0-24 months 
plots 
(Figs. 3A-D). 
Most correlations for lambs were 
low, nonsig- 
nificant, and negative. An annual pattern of 

negative correlations for ewe kills and kill rate 

versus number of coyotes removed appeared for 
lags of 3-11 months. Correlations were all low; 
97% of all confidence 
intervals contained zero. 
However, there were more negative correlations 
than 
expected 
at 
random 
for 
lags of 
1-12 
months 
(P < 
0.001 
for all 
independent 
vari- 
ables) and lags of 13-24 months (P < 0.006 for 
all 
independent 
variables). Post 
hoc 
power 
ranged from 0.17 to 0.72 for the cross-correla- 
tion 
coefficients. 
Post hoc power 
regression 
analyses (Zar 1984) indicated effect sizes from 
r = 0.37 for no lag to r = 0.41 for a 24-month 
lag were needed 
to ensure 90% power. 
All of the highest correlations were negative; 
that 
is, the numbers of sheep killed and kill 
rates decreased with increasing numbers of coy- 
otes removed 
(Table 1). The 12-month 
lag of 
the number of coyotes removed had the highest 
correlation 
coefficient 
for number 
of 
lambs 
killed (Fig. 3A) and lamb kill rate (Fig. 3C). The 
7-9-, 21-, and 23-month 
lags of number of coy- 
otes removed had the highest correlation coef- 
ficients for number of ewes killed (Fig. 3B) and 
ewe kill rate (Fig. 3D). 
Two of the 
seasonal correlations were bor- 
derline significant. These were for ewe kills and 
kill rates during ewes 1, when coyotes were re- 
moved during 
lambing 2 
(ewes killed: r19 = 
-0.51, 
P = 0.074; kill rate: r19 = 
-0.51, 
P = 
0.063).

COYOTE SHEEP DEPREDATION * Conner et al. 

J. Wildl. Manage. 62(2):1998 

there was no relation between number of lambs 
killed and number of coyotes removed. If only 
certain coyotes kill sheep, 
increasing numbers 
of coyotes removed will have no effect on num- 
ber of sheep killed unless the problem coyote 
is removed. Thus, the lack of relation between 
number of lambs killed and number of coyotes 
removed may be because most of the coyotes 
removed were not killing sheep. Superficially, 
low power appears the culprit in failure to find 
a relation between 
sheep killing and coyote re- 
movals, but 
low power was an artifact of low 
effect sizes. 
Nonlagged monthly patterns of coyote 
re- 
moval 
suggest 
that coyote 
control at HREC 
tended to be more corrective than preventative 
in that peaks of removals occurred in February 
and April, when 
lamb killing was greatest, and 
in July through September, when ewe killing 
was greatest (Fig. 1). All response variables for 
ewe and lamb killing were positively correlated 
with numbers of coyotes removed on a yearly 
and monthly basis. Although none of the cor- 
relations were significant, the consistent pattern 
of positive correlations was evidence 
there was 
a corrective element 
of coyote removal prac- 
ticed at HREC. 

Alternatively, 
increased 
coyote 
population 
densities on HREC could result in high num- 
bers of kills and coyote removals. Whether high 
depredation 
losses and high numbers of coyote 
removals were positively correlated with high 
coyote population densities 
is unknown. How- 
ever, annual number of coyotes removed was 
correlated with 
annual number 
of 
positively 
trapper hours worked at HREC, suggesting that 
years with higher coyote removals were years 
with more trapping effort. Also, annual number 
of 
lambs killed was positively correlated with 
annual trapper hours, suggesting 
that the cor- 
rective responses focused on number of lambs 
killed. If number of lambs killed and coyotes 
removed were not positively correlated to trap- 
per hours, then fluctuations in coyote density as 
the 
cause 
of higher depredation 
underlying 
would be a likely conclusion. Hence, number of 
removed 
at HREC 
likely was deter- 
coyotes 
mined by number of lambs killed rather than 
vice versa. 

Coyote removal during the second 
lambing 
season reduced ewe depredation during the fol- 
lowing 3-month season. Coyote removal may re- 
duce ewe depredation more than lamb depre- 
dation because 
the corrective nature of control 

with respect 
to 
lambs 
leads to a preventative 
strategy with respect to ewes. However, the ma- 
jority of negative correlations at all lags suggests 
some preventative effect of coyote removal for 
both lambs and ewes. However, preventative ef- 
fects were 
low; the highest negative coefficient 
of determination was 0.08, 
indicating that only 
about 8.4% of the variability in kill rates can be 
explained by the removal of coyotes. Low effect 
sizes and correlations between kills and number 
of coyotes 
removed within years may be ex- 
plained by the lack of consistency 
in removing 
the offending coyotes. 
There was no indication that removal of coy- 
otes reduced predation the following year (i.e., 
intervals >12 months), 
that 
lagged 
suggesting 
coyote density was not being reduced by re- 
moval efforts. Thus, 1 year later, territories of 
removed coyotes were replaced. There are at 
least 3 explanations for this result. First, immi- 
gration may be density dependent, 
thus en- 
abling coyote densities to remain at or near sat- 
uration 
levels 
(Knowlton and Stoddart 1983). 
For coyote density to be decreased, 
there must 
be 
isolation 
from other coyotes 
geographical 
within a dispersible distance, or there must be 
methods 
available, 
such 
as aerial 
gunning, 
whereby high numbers of coyotes can be con- 
sistently removed. The HREC 
is a relatively 
small area (2,168 ha). Aerial gunning was not 
an option, and control efforts could not prevent 
from adjacent 
immigration 
areas, 
including 
30,000 ha of land with no coyote control. Sec- 
ond, control moralities may be only compensa- 
tory (Gese et al. 1989). Third, coyote reproduc- 
tive flexibility may make it extremely difficult to 
reduce 
coyote 
density, 
even within HREC 
boundaries. Pregnancy rates (Gier 1968), litter 
size, and pup 
survival (Knowlton 1972, Gier 
1975, Connolly 1978, Knowlton and Stoddart 
1983, Sterling et al. 1983) are inversely corre- 
lated to coyote population density, which allows 
a coyote population to maintain itself except at 
very high 
levels of control 
(Clark 1972, Con- 
nolly and Longhurst 1975). Thus, 
if lamb and 
ewe 
losses were positively correlated with coy- 
ote population levels, then extremely high levels 
of coyote removal on HREC and surrounding 
areas would be required annually to decrease 
losses. 
depredation 
The relation between number of coyotes re- 
moved and subsequent sheep kills was irregular 
and highly variable among months. This vari- 
ability may be due, in part, to factors other than

inconsistent 
removals of problem coyotes. For 
example, the effect of trapper-removed coyotes 
may have been confounded by additional coyote 
removals 
by HREC 
personnel, 
hunters, 
or 
neighboring ranches, but there was no reason 
to suspect such removals. In general, very few 
additional coyotes 
(0-3) were 
likely removed 
from the immediate 
study area each year, and 
these removals were opportunistic and random 
in relation to when and where depredation oc- 
curred. Also, variation among 
trappers could 
confound 
the results. However, only 2 trappers 
were 
in charge during 
the 
study period; 
the 
same trapper worked from 1981 to 1988, and a 
second trapper worked from 1989 to 1992. We 
feel trapper effort was a response 
to depreda- 
tion and was directed to when and where losses 
were occurring. If trapper removals were effec- 
tive, 
then 
there 
should be 
reduced 
losses at 
some monthly 
lag, irrespective of other occa- 
sional and temporally scattered removals. 

Factors Influencing Efficacy of Coyote 
Removal 

Coyote removals on the HREC have had a 
limited effect on reducing sheep 
losses, which 
suggests depredating coyotes were not being re- 
moved, but our result may not apply to other 
sheep operations where coyotes are removed. 
However, a number of factors likely influence 
the efficacy of coyote removal that is not selec- 
tive to the offending animal, and these 
factors 
vary among situations. First, the vulnerability of 
offending coyotes to removal may vary between 
fixed grazing and range operation. Adult, breed- 
ing territorial coyotes are thought the principal 
killers of 
livestock 
(Till and Knowlton 
1983, 
Windberg and Knowlton 1990, Sacks 1996) and 
may be difficult 
to 
remove by conventional 
means 
of 
control 
(Windberg 
and Knowlton 
1988, 1990; Sacks 1996) in areas where animals 
have prior exposure to capture efforts. The con- 
trol techniques used on HREC were primarily 
trapping, and M-44s. Windberg and 
snaring, 
Knowlton (1990) 
found no difference between 
adults and juveniles 
in relative vulnerability to 
M-44s and leghold traps. This finding contrasts 
to Sacks (1996) who reported that M-44s were 
effective 
against juvenile and yearling coyotes 
but were 
ineffective against adults. The princi- 
pal difference between 
these 
studies was the 
long history of control at HREC, where capture 
efforts had been 
intensive. The Windberg and 
Knowlton 
study was done where prior 

(1990) 

exposure to capture efforts was unlikely. Coyo- 
tes exposed 
to control may become wary and 
harder to remove. This interpretation is consis- 
tent with the findings of Brand et al. (1995) in 
southern Africa who 
found 
that adult black- 
backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) avoided coy- 
ote-getters when 
exposure duration increased 
and resulted in high proportions of young jack- 
als taken. Thus, in areas where coyotes are naive 
with respect 
to control efforts, removal of the 
problem 
territorial animals may be more suc- 
cessful. At HREC or other pasture operations 
with consistent coyote control, typical removal 
efforts may differentially remove young coyotes 
and only occasionally remove problem coyotes, 
resulting in weak negative correlations between 
total coyotes 
removed and subsequent 
sheep 
kills. 
Second, there may be seasonal differences 
in 
the vulnerability of coyotes 
to removal. Adult 
territorial coyotes become more vulnerable 
to 
trapping and M-44s during pup rearing season 
(Till and Knowlton 1983, Sacks 1996). 
If the 
peak of lamb killing occurs simultaneously with 
pup rearing, then removal of problem animals 
may be more successful than at HREC, where 
pup rearing begins 2 months after the peak of 
lambing 
season 
and 
lamb killing. Removing 
denning coyotes or their pups can stop nearby 
(Till and Knowlton 1983). In situ- 
depredation 
ations such as north-coastal California, where 
lambing occurs during winter and 
is out-of- 
phase with pup rearing, it may be more difficult 
to remove the territorial animals responsible for 
most of the killing versus removals in range or 
pasture 
operations where 
pup 
rearing 
and 
lambing coincide. 
Third, prey availability may buffer depreda- 
tion (Hamlin et al. 1984, Mech 1988) or curtail 
the length of high predation rates. Other studies 
have 
found 2 peaks in sheep 
losses 
to coyote 
predation similar to those on HREC: 1 in spring 
during lambing season, and another in late sum- 
mer and fall (Rosko 1948, Klebenow and Mc- 
Adoo 1976, Tigner and Larsen 1977, McAdoo 
and Klebenow 1978). The abundance of food 
during early summer, in the form of mule deer 
(Odocoileus hemionus) 
fawns or small mam- 
mals, possibly can replace 
sheep 
as the pre- 
ferred coyote prey. Thus, for range or pasture 
operations, 
there may be a similarity in tem- 
poral fluctuations 
in coyote predation. Timing 
of removal efforts may vary among operations, 
but timing removal to occur just prior to know

peaks of predation should be the strategy on all 
types of operations. 

MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS 

Results of the analyses presented here sug- 
gest 
the need 
for more selective 
targeting of 
coyotes. 
Situations 
similar to 
the HREC 
are 
likely common among sheep grazed on private 
land and where 
local population reduction 
is 
perennial and nonselective. A method 
that 
is 
selective 
for sheep-killing 
coyotes 
is the 1080 
Livestock Protection Collar, which is limited in 
availability by restrictions necessary for its safe 
use. Denning 
in dens) and 
(i.e., killing pups 
shooting of territorial animals located 
in areas 
of high killing may be a practical selective strat- 
egy. Timing of control should occur just before 
annual peaks 
in 
losses, 
such as just prior to 
lambing, otherwise 
the removal of a problem 
coyote can result in its replacement before peak 
killing times. Real effects of coyote removal will 
not be fully known unless a proper experiment 
with a treatment 
(coyote removal) and control 
site with no coyote removal is examined for ef- 
fects on predation rates. Monitoring the effect 
of 
coyote 
removals 
on 
subsequent 
livestock 
depredation 
is also a necessary component 
of 
effective management.
