Abstract: We used 13 years of historical data to investigate effects of coyote (Canis latrans) removal on 
depredation of domestic sheep. The 2,168-ha study area maintained >1,000 breeding ewes that produced 
lambs yearly. Records from 1981 through 1994, which included numbers of sheep, numbers of sheep known 
killed by coyotes, known numbers of coyotes removed, and annual numbers of trapper hours were summarized 
and analyzed on a yearly, seasonal, and monthly basis. We used regression analysis and found that annual, 
seasonal, or monthly depredation losses were not correlated with number of coyotes removed. Both annual 
number of lambs killed and number of coyotes removed were positively correlated with number of trapper 
hours. We used a cross-correlation analysis to detect any relation between coyote removal and subsequent 
depredation losses at all monthly intervals from 0 to 24 months. We found a trend of low negative correlation 
between depredation losses and number of coyotes removed for lags of 2-12 months, suggesting some reduction 
of sheep killing due to control efforts. Low correlations within years may be due to inconsistent removal of 
depredating coyotes while removing primarily young, nondepredating coyotes. Lack of correlation between 
years may have occurred because past control efforts have not had a lasting reduction on coyote density due 
to immigration, the compensatory nature of control efforts on coyote mortality, reproductive compensation in 
the resident coyote population, or all 3 factors.

Coyote predation on domestic sheep remains 
a chronic problem in the western United States. 
A principal control strategy is perennial removal 
of coyotes from livestock operations (Andelt 
1996). This local population reduction is selec- 
tive with respect to the damage site but not nec- 

essarily selective to particular coyotes that kill 

sheep (Connolly 1978). Studies have been con- 
ducted on coyote predation at sheep operations 
in the presence and absence of removal (Kle- 
benow and McAdoo 1976, Henne 1977, Nass 
1977, Tigner and Larson 1977, McAdoo and 
Klebenow 1978). However, variation in annual 

predation rates between studies and variation in 

types and intensities of predator control pro- 
duced inconclusive results (U.S. Department of 
the Interior 1978, Pearson 1986). Also, because 

of the cost of direct field studies, only a small 
fraction of the sheep industry has been studied. 
Of 18 of the large coyote-sheep predation stud- 
ies compiled by the U.S. Department of the In- 
terior (1978) for their comprehensive review of 

predator damage in the West, 10 were field 
studies and 8 were questionnaire studies. Du- 
ration of the field studies was short: 1 field study 
was >5 years, while the remaining 7 studies 
were -3 years in duration. Also, the 8 ques- 
tionnaire studies may be biased by overestimat- 

ing losses to ensure federal aid for predator 
control (U.S. Department of the Interior 1978, 
Pearson 1986), making the effectiveness of con- 
trol efforts difficult to evaluate. 

This study was done on the Hopland Re- 
search and Extension Center (HREC), a sheep 
ranch in northern California where coyote dep- 
redation has been chronic (Scrivner et al. 1985, 
Timm 1990). The HREC offers a unique op- 
portunity for study of coyote predation on 

sheep because (1) the dataset on coyote-killed 
sheep and coyote removals extends over a long 
period of time (13 yr); (2) daily records of coy-

ote-killed sheep and coyote removals were kept 
for 13 years, allowing analyses of predation 
within and between years; (3) sheep were man- 

aged by university employees, which made re- 
cords of coyote-killed sheep more accurate and 
unbiased; and (4) the HREC is similar to many 
sheep operations in the West, where over half 
of the feed supplied for commercial sheep 
comes from private land (U.S. Department of 
the Interior 1978), typically in pasture grazing. 
To add to the body of information on effective- 
ness of coyote control, we focus our analysis on 

long-term patterns of sheep depredation with 

respect to coyote removal efforts at 3 different 
time scales: yearly, seasonally, and monthly. 

STUDY AREA 
The University of California's HREC is a 

sheep research facility located in Mendocino 

County, California. Elevations ranged from 150 
to 915 m. The HREC experienced a typical 
Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers, 
and mild, rainy winters. Average annual precip- 
itation was 92 cm; summer rainfall was rare. Av- 

erage temperatures ranged from 80C in winter 
to 210C in summer. The vegetation of HREC 
was a mosaic of 4 habitat types: grassland 
(27%), woodland-grass (33%), dense woodland 
(20%), and chaparral (19%; Murphy and Heady 
1983). Common grassland species were wild 
oats (Avena barbata), ripgutt (Bromus dian- 
drus), and foxtail (Festuca megalura). Wood- 

land-grass patches were dominated by blue oak 

(Quercus douglasii), valley oak (Q. lobata), and 
interior live oak (Q. wislizenii); dense woodland 
was dominated by black oak (Q. kelloggii), ma- 
drone (Arbutus menziesii), and California bay 
(Umbellularia californica). Chaparral occurred 

mainly above 610 m and included chamise (Ad- 
enostoma fasciculatum), ceanothus (Ceanothus 
cuneatus), manzanita (Arctostaphylos spp.), and 
scrub oak (Q. durata). 

The HREC maintained 900-1,500 ewes dis- 

persed among 32 fenced pastures averaging 80 
ha each. Sheep were rotated among pastures 
according to range quality and research needs. 

Typically, 8-12 of the pastures contained sheep 
at any time. Shepherds did not stay with the 
sheep in the pastures but checked pastures 
weekly. Between 700 and 1,300 lambs were 
born during 2 seasons between mid-November 
and March. Lambs were born in a main barn 
and held for at least 48 hr prior to placement 
in pastures. 

Average annual predation rates of ewes 
(2.0%) and lambs (3.1%) at HREC were similar 
to those experienced in many operations in the 
West (U.S. Department of the Interior 1978, 
Pearson 1986). Coyote density over the entire 

study period is unknown. However, density es- 
timates for the 21.68-km2 study area, from pre- 
and postwhelping during 1994-95, were 0.59 

coyotes/km2 (95% CI = 0.41-0.95) for coyotes 
>5 months old, and 0.76 coyotes/km2 (96% CI 
= 0.50-1.41) for coyotes of all ages (Sacks 
1996). Trapping, snaring, and, more recently, 
M-44s have been the primary coyote removal 
methods, but shooting and denning (Till and 
Knowlton 1983) also have been used. Coyote 
removal at HREC was similar to other western 

sheep operations (Gee et al. 1977, U.S. De- 

partment of the Interior 1978), particularly 
those in northcentral California. The HREC has 
records of sheep availability, sheep distribution, 
and dates and locations of predator kills from 
1981 to 1994. Additionally, U.S. Department of 

Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspec- 
tion Service, Wildlife Services program (WS; 
formally known as Animal Damage Control or 
ADC) records of coyote removals and annual 

trapper hours worked on HREC were available 
for the same period. 

METHODS 
We summarized 13 years of historical data 

from the HREC from 1981 to 1994 (1986 data 
were missing). Records were kept on a monthly 
basis and included number, age classification, 
and sex of sheep in each pasture, as well as age 
and sex of all coyote-killed sheep. Coyote kills 
were typically identified by hemorrhaging un- 
der the skin at the throat (Wade and Bowns 
1985). The daily pattern of pasture searching 
was consistent from year-to-year, although 
search effort may have been less during 1991- 
92. Within years, pastures with sheep were vis- 
ited most days, but pastures with lambs were 
searched more often. Numbers of coyote-killed 
sheep did not include the sheep missing in each 

pasture, because this number was not accurate- 

ly recorded on a monthly basis. The same shep- 
herd worked on the station from 1981 to 1994; 
hence, search effort and recording of missing 
animals were relatively consistent from year-to- 
year (J. Hays, HREC, personal communica- 
tion). Annual records of missing lambs were 
available for 1977-79 and 1990-94. We exclud- 
ed missing lambs from predation analyses be-

cause missing lambs were only recorded at 

weaning and sale, there was no relation be- 
tween annual numbers of missing lambs and 
number of lambs killed or number of coyotes 
removed, and causes of missing sheep could not 
be determined (e.g., whether due to coyote, 
mountain lion [Felis concolor], black bear [Urus 
americanus], golden eagle [Aquila chrysaetos], 
disease, exposure, miscounts, etc.). 

We also used WS records of date and number 
of coyotes 'removed and of annual trapper hours 
from September 1981 through August 1994. 
Annual number of coyotes removed by the WS 

represents a minimum because HREC person- 
nel, neighbors, and seasonal hunters occasion- 

ally removed coyotes (typically by shooting), but 
these efforts were random and independent 
with respect to efforts of control personnel. 
Coyote pups were not included in the analyses. 
Thus, the population of interest was the total 
number of sheep killed by coyotes and the total 
number of coyotes removed by WS personnel 
on HREC. All analyses in this study were done 
on a sample; that is, known coyote-killed sheep 
and known coyote removals are a sample of the 
total number killed and total number removed. 

Depredation losses were represented by the 
known number of lambs or ewes killed, and 
lamb or ewe kill rates. Kill rates were the pro- 
portion of lambs and ewes killed per month or 

year, per number of lambs or ewes available. 
Lambs were present on HREC from November 

through mid-May, and only the months of this 

period were used in analyses involving lambs. 
To avoid confounding patterns of ewe and lamb 

killing, only months when lambs were absent 

(May-Oct) were used in analyses involving 
ewes. Removal of coyotes, which could take 

place during any month of the year, was re- 

gressed against only months when lambs were 

present. The HREC retained relatively small 
numbers of older lambs as replacements, and 
these were lambs were counted as ewes, begin- 
ning in May. 

We examined annual patterns of predation 
through relations between the known number 
and rate of sheep killed, known number of coy- 
otes removed, total number of trapper hours 
spent on HREC, and number of missing sheep. 
We determined effects of coyote removal on 
depredation losses by regressing annual number 
of lambs and ewes killed and kill rates against 
number of coyotes removed, with the null hy- 
pothesis that depredation losses were not cor- 

related with the number of coyotes removed on 
a yearly basis. We regressed annual number of 
lambs and ewes killed and kill rates against an- 
nual trapper hours to evaluate if control on 
HREC, at least annually, was preventative or 
corrective. The null hypothesis was that number 
of kills or kill rates were not related to trapping 
effort. We regressed annual number of coyotes 
removed against annual trapper hours to eval- 
uate if numbers removed were related to effort 
and not to changes in coyote population densi- 
ties. The null hypothesis was that trapping ef- 
fort was not related to number of coyotes re- 
moved. Lastly, we regressed annual number of 
total kills (ewes plus lambs) against annual num- 
ber of missing sheep to evaluate if missing 
sheep could be confounding the relation be- 
tween number of kills and number of coyote 
removals. The null hypothesis was that number 
of kills was not related to number of missing 
sheep. 

We examined monthly patterns of predation 
by regressing number of lambs and ewes killed 
and kill rate against number of coyotes re- 
moved. The null hypothesis was that depreda- 
tion losses were not related to the number of 

coyotes removed on a monthly basis. However, 
correlations between the number of lambs and 
ewes killed, or kill rate, and the number of coy- 
otes removed could occur at intervals different 
than 1 month or year. For example, removing 3 

coyotes in 1 month might not decrease the 
number of lambs and ewes killed until the fol- 

lowing month, or the following year. Therefore, 
we used a cross-correlation analysis (Diggle 
1990) to detect correlations at all monthly in- 
tervals from 0 to 24 months. Negative correla- 
tions between coyote depredation losses and 
number of coyotes removed would suggest that 

coyote removal was decreasing future depre- 
dation. Positive correlations may indicate a dis- 

ruption in existing coyote territories, whereby 
more coyotes have access to sheep, which re- 
sults in increased depredation. The null hypoth- 
esis was that depredation losses were not relat- 
ed to number of coyotes previously removed for 

lags of 0-24 months. 
Seasonal analyses were conducted by parti- 

tioning time to examine the effects of lamb 
presence. Because coyote predation on sheep 
may be related to timing of lamb and sheep use 
and not related to calendar months, we per- 
formed an analysis based on seasonal changes 
in sheep production: lambing I = November,

Fig. 1. (A) Annual number of lambs killed, (B) number of ewes killed, (C) lamb kill rate, and (D) ewe kill rate versus number 
of coyotes removed from Hopland Research and Extension Center, California, September 1981-August 1994. 

December, and January; lambing 2 = February, 
March, and April; ewes 1 = May, June, and 

July; and ewes 2 = August, September, and Oc- 
tober. Both number of kills and number of coy- 
otes removed were grouped by these seasons. 
We regressed seasonal number of lambs and 
ewes killed and kill against number of coyotes 
removed. Because removal may reduce subse- 

quent killing, numbers of coyotes removed were 

regressed at lags of 1-4 seasons. The null hy- 
pothesis was that depredation losses were not 
related to the number of coyotes removed on a 
seasonal basis. 

Statistical analyses of the historical data were 

post hoc. We used a = 0.05 in all analyses. Pow- 
er analyses on the correlation coefficients were 
based on a 1-sided alternative hypothesis (i.e., 

Ho: p 
= 0 vs. HI: p < 0). The relations between 

coyote removal and kill rates cannot be consid- 
ered causal because of the observational nature 
of this study. We verified assumptions of nor- 

mality, equal variance, and linearity of residuals 
for all regression analyses (Ott 1993). 

RESULTS 
Annual lamb and ewe kills and kill rates were 

not correlated with the number of coyotes re- 
moved (P > 0.05; Figs. 1A-D). There was a 

positive correlation between number of lambs 
killed per year and number of trapper hours 
worked on HREC per year (r12 = 0.68, P = 

0.015), but lamb kill rate was not correlated to 

trapper hours (r12 = 0.50, P = 0.095, 1 - P = 
0.64). There was also a positive correlation be- 
tween number of coyotes removed per year and 
number of trapper hours worked on HREC per 
year (r12 = 0.75, P = 0.003). Neither number 
of ewes killed nor ewe kill rate was correlated 
with number of trapper hours on an annual ba- 
sis (ewes killed: r12 = 0.20, P = 0.530, 1 - = 

0.19; kill rate: r12 = 0.14, P = 0.658, 1 - P = 
0.15). Post hoc power analyses (Zar 1984) in-

dicated an effect size of r = 0.76 was needed 
to ensure 90% power for annual regression 
analyses. Annual mean number of coyotes re- 
moved was 10.8 (SE = 1.6, n = 13). Annual 
mean number of missing sheep was 177 (SE = 

8.9, n = 8), which was an average of 11.8% (SE 
= 0.5, n = 8) of the HREC flock. Annual num- 
ber of missing sheep was not correlated with 
annual number of kills (r7 = 0.55, P = 0.205, 1 
- p1 = 0.49). 

Plots of mean monthly sheep kills and coyo- 
tes removed showed highest lamb kills and 
lamb kill rates occurred during January through 
April, while ewe kills and kill rates were highest 
during July through September (Figs. 2A,B). 
Coyote removals occurred over the entire year, 
with peaks in February, April, and September 
(Figs. 2A,B). Neither monthly number of lambs 
killed nor lamb kill rate was correlated with 
number of coyotes removed (lambs killed: r71 
= 0.19, P = 0.117, 1 - 1 = 0.47; kill rate: r71 
= 0.20, P = 0.093, 1 - 13 = 0.51). Similarly, 
neither monthly number of ewes killed nor ewe 

kill rate was correlated with number of coyotes 
removed (ewes killed: r71 = 0.16, P = 0.196, 1 
- 13 = 0.48; kill rate r71 = 0.22, P = 0.071, 1 
- 13 = 0.56). Post hoc power analyses (Zar 
1984) indicated an effect size of r = 0.37 was 
needed to ensure 90% power for monthly re- 

gression analyses. 
Monthly effects of coyote removal on num- 

ber of lambs and ewes subsequently killed and 

proportion of lambs and ewes subsequently 
killed were determined via cross-correlation 

plots for lags of 0-24 months (Figs. 3A-D). 
Most correlations for lambs were low, nonsig- 
nificant, and negative. An annual pattern of 

negative correlations for ewe kills and kill rate 
versus number of coyotes removed appeared for 

lags of 3-11 months. Correlations were all low; 
97% of all confidence intervals contained zero. 
However, there were more negative correlations 
than expected at random for lags of 1-12 

months (P < 0.001 for all independent vari- 

ables) and lags of 13-24 months (P < 0.006 for 
all independent variables). Post hoc power 
ranged from 0.17 to 0.72 for the cross-correla- 
tion regression coefficients. Post hoc power 
analyses (Zar 1984) indicated effect sizes from 
r = 0.37 for no lag to r = 0.41 for a 24-month 

lag were needed to ensure 90% power. 
All of the highest correlations were negative; 

that is, the numbers of sheep killed and kill 
rates decreased with increasing numbers of coy- 
otes removed (Table 1). The 12-month lag of 
the number of coyotes removed had the highest 
correlation coefficient for number of lambs 
killed (Fig. 3A) and lamb kill rate (Fig. 3C). The 

7-9-, 21-, and 23-month lags of number of coy- 
otes removed had the highest correlation coef- 
ficients for number of ewes killed (Fig. 3B) and 
ewe kill rate (Fig. 3D). 

Two of the seasonal correlations were bor- 
derline significant. These were for ewe kills and 
kill rates during ewes 1, when coyotes were re- 
moved during lambing 2 (ewes killed: r19 = 

-0.51, P = 0.074; kill rate: r19 = -0.51, P = 

0.063). 

DISCUSSION 

Temporal Patterns 
On an annual scale, there were significant 

positive correlations between the number of 
lambs killed and number of trapper hours 
worked and number of coyotes removed and 
number of trapper hours worked. However,

there was no relation between number of lambs 
killed and number of coyotes removed. If only 
certain coyotes kill sheep, increasing numbers 
of coyotes removed will have no effect on num- 
ber of sheep killed unless the problem coyote 
is removed. Thus, the lack of relation between 
number of lambs killed and number of coyotes 
removed may be because most of the coyotes 
removed were not killing sheep. Superficially, 
low power appears the culprit in failure to find 
a relation between sheep killing and coyote re- 
movals, but low power was an artifact of low 
effect sizes. 

Nonlagged monthly patterns of coyote re- 
moval suggest that coyote control at HREC 
tended to be more corrective than preventative 
in that peaks of removals occurred in February 
and April, when lamb killing was greatest, and 
in July through September, when ewe killing 
was greatest (Fig. 1). All response variables for 
ewe and lamb killing were positively correlated 
with numbers of coyotes removed on a yearly 
and monthly basis. Although none of the cor- 
relations were significant, the consistent pattern 
of positive correlations was evidence there was 
a corrective element of coyote removal prac- 
ticed at HREC. 

Alternatively, increased coyote population 
densities on HREC could result in high num- 
bers of kills and coyote removals. Whether high 
depredation losses and high numbers of coyote 
removals were positively correlated with high 
coyote population densities is unknown. How- 
ever, annual number of coyotes removed was 

positively correlated with annual number of 

trapper hours worked at HREC, suggesting that 

years with higher coyote removals were years 
with more trapping effort. Also, annual number 
of lambs killed was positively correlated with 
annual trapper hours, suggesting that the cor- 
rective responses focused on number of lambs 
killed. If number of lambs killed and coyotes 
removed were not positively correlated to trap- 
per hours, then fluctuations in coyote density as 
the underlying cause of higher depredation 
would be a likely conclusion. Hence, number of 

coyotes removed at HREC likely was deter- 
mined by number of lambs killed rather than 
vice versa. 

Coyote removal during the second lambing 
season reduced ewe depredation during the fol- 
lowing 3-month season. Coyote removal may re- 
duce ewe depredation more than lamb depre- 
dation because the corrective nature of control 

with respect to lambs leads to a preventative 
strategy with respect to ewes. However, the ma- 

jority of negative correlations at all lags suggests 
some preventative effect of coyote removal for 
both lambs and ewes. However, preventative ef- 
fects were low; the highest negative coefficient 
of determination was 0.08, indicating that only 
about 8.4% of the variability in kill rates can be 

explained by the removal of coyotes. Low effect 
sizes and correlations between kills and number 
of coyotes removed within years may be ex- 

plained by the lack of consistency in removing 
the offending coyotes. 

There was no indication that removal of coy- 
otes reduced predation the following year (i.e., 
lagged intervals >12 months), suggesting that 

coyote density was not being reduced by re- 
moval efforts. Thus, 1 year later, territories of 
removed coyotes were replaced. There are at 
least 3 explanations for this result. First, immi- 

gration may be density dependent, thus en- 

abling coyote densities to remain at or near sat- 
uration levels (Knowlton and Stoddart 1983). 
For coyote density to be decreased, there must 
be geographical isolation from other coyotes 
within a dispersible distance, or there must be 
methods available, such as aerial gunning, 
whereby high numbers of coyotes can be con- 

sistently removed. The HREC is a relatively 
small area (2,168 ha). Aerial gunning was not 
an option, and control efforts could not prevent 
immigration from adjacent areas, including 
30,000 ha of land with no coyote control. Sec- 
ond, control moralities may be only compensa- 
tory (Gese et al. 1989). Third, coyote reproduc- 
tive flexibility may make it extremely difficult to 
reduce coyote density, even within HREC 
boundaries. Pregnancy rates (Gier 1968), litter 
size, and pup survival (Knowlton 1972, Gier 
1975, Connolly 1978, Knowlton and Stoddart 
1983, Sterling et al. 1983) are inversely corre- 
lated to coyote population density, which allows 
a coyote population to maintain itself except at 

very high levels of control (Clark 1972, Con- 

nolly and Longhurst 1975). Thus, if lamb and 
ewe losses were positively correlated with coy- 
ote population levels, then extremely high levels 
of coyote removal on HREC and surrounding 
areas would be required annually to decrease 
depredation losses. 

The relation between number of coyotes re- 
moved and subsequent sheep kills was irregular 
and highly variable among months. This vari- 
ability may be due, in part, to factors other than

inconsistent removals of problem coyotes. For 

example, the effect of trapper-removed coyotes 
may have been confounded by additional coyote 
removals by HREC personnel, hunters, or 

neighboring ranches, but there was no reason 
to suspect such removals. In general, very few 
additional coyotes (0-3) were likely removed 
from the immediate study area each year, and 
these removals were opportunistic and random 
in relation to when and where depredation oc- 
curred. Also, variation among trappers could 
confound the results. However, only 2 trappers 
were in charge during the study period; the 
same trapper worked from 1981 to 1988, and a 
second trapper worked from 1989 to 1992. We 
feel trapper effort was a response to depreda- 
tion and was directed to when and where losses 
were occurring. If trapper removals were effec- 
tive, then there should be reduced losses at 
some monthly lag, irrespective of other occa- 
sional and temporally scattered removals. 

Factors Influencing Efficacy of Coyote 
Removal 

Coyote removals on the HREC have had a 
limited effect on reducing sheep losses, which 

suggests depredating coyotes were not being re- 
moved, but our result may not apply to other 

sheep operations where coyotes are removed. 
However, a number of factors likely influence 
the efficacy of coyote removal that is not selec- 
tive to the offending animal, and these factors 

vary among situations. First, the vulnerability of 

offending coyotes to removal may vary between 
fixed grazing and range operation. Adult, breed- 

ing territorial coyotes are thought the principal 
killers of livestock (Till and Knowlton 1983, 
Windberg and Knowlton 1990, Sacks 1996) and 

may be difficult to remove by conventional 
means of control (Windberg and Knowlton 
1988, 1990; Sacks 1996) in areas where animals 
have prior exposure to capture efforts. The con- 
trol techniques used on HREC were primarily 
snaring, trapping, and M-44s. Windberg and 
Knowlton (1990) found no difference between 
adults and juveniles in relative vulnerability to 
M-44s and leghold traps. This finding contrasts 
to Sacks (1996) who reported that M-44s were 
effective against juvenile and yearling coyotes 
but were ineffective against adults. The princi- 
pal difference between these studies was the 
long history of control at HREC, where capture 
efforts had been intensive. The Windberg and 
Knowlton (1990) study was done where prior 

exposure to capture efforts was unlikely. Coyo- 
tes exposed to control may become wary and 
harder to remove. This interpretation is consis- 
tent with the findings of Brand et al. (1995) in 
southern Africa who found that adult black- 
backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) avoided coy- 
ote-getters when exposure duration increased 
and resulted in high proportions of young jack- 
als taken. Thus, in areas where coyotes are naive 
with respect to control efforts, removal of the 

problem territorial animals may be more suc- 
cessful. At HREC or other pasture operations 
with consistent coyote control, typical removal 
efforts may differentially remove young coyotes 
and only occasionally remove problem coyotes, 
resulting in weak negative correlations between 
total coyotes removed and subsequent sheep 
kills. 

Second, there may be seasonal differences in 
the vulnerability of coyotes to removal. Adult 
territorial coyotes become more vulnerable to 

trapping and M-44s during pup rearing season 
(Till and Knowlton 1983, Sacks 1996). If the 

peak of lamb killing occurs simultaneously with 

pup rearing, then removal of problem animals 

may be more successful than at HREC, where 

pup rearing begins 2 months after the peak of 

lambing season and lamb killing. Removing 
denning coyotes or their pups can stop nearby 
depredation (Till and Knowlton 1983). In situ- 
ations such as north-coastal California, where 

lambing occurs during winter and is out-of- 

phase with pup rearing, it may be more difficult 
to remove the territorial animals responsible for 
most of the killing versus removals in range or 

pasture operations where pup rearing and 

lambing coincide. 
Third, prey availability may buffer depreda- 

tion (Hamlin et al. 1984, Mech 1988) or curtail 
the length of high predation rates. Other studies 
have found 2 peaks in sheep losses to coyote 
predation similar to those on HREC: 1 in spring 
during lambing season, and another in late sum- 
mer and fall (Rosko 1948, Klebenow and Mc- 
Adoo 1976, Tigner and Larsen 1977, McAdoo 
and Klebenow 1978). The abundance of food 

during early summer, in the form of mule deer 
(Odocoileus hemionus) fawns or small mam- 
mals, possibly can replace sheep as the pre- 
ferred coyote prey. Thus, for range or pasture 
operations, there may be a similarity in tem- 
poral fluctuations in coyote predation. Timing 
of removal efforts may vary among operations, 
but timing removal to occur just prior to know

peaks of predation should be the strategy on all 

types of operations. 

MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS 
Results of the analyses presented here sug- 

gest the need for more selective targeting of 

coyotes. Situations similar to the HREC are 

likely common among sheep grazed on private 
land and where local population reduction is 

perennial and nonselective. A method that is 
selective for sheep-killing coyotes is the 1080 
Livestock Protection Collar, which is limited in 

availability by restrictions necessary for its safe 
use. Denning (i.e., killing pups in dens) and 

shooting of territorial animals located in areas 
of high killing may be a practical selective strat- 

egy. Timing of control should occur just before 
annual peaks in losses, such as just prior to 

lambing, otherwise the removal of a problem 
coyote can result in its replacement before peak 
killing times. Real effects of coyote removal will 
not be fully known unless a proper experiment 
with a treatment (coyote removal) and control 
site with no coyote removal is examined for ef- 
fects on predation rates. Monitoring the effect 
of coyote removals on subsequent livestock 

depredation is also a necessary component of 
effective management.
