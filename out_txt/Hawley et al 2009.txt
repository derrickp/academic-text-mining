ABSTRACT Lethal control alone has not proven entirely effective in reducing gray wolf (Canis lupus) depredations in chronic problem
areas. Opponents of lethal control argue that more emphasis should be placed on integrating nonlethal strategies into current management.

However, few evaluations have tested the effectiveness of nonlethal options. We compared behavior patterns in terms of frequency and duration

of bait station visits for 5 wolves fitted with shock collars to 5 control animals inhabiting wolf pack territories in northern Wisconsin during

summers of 2003 and 2004. Shock collared wolves spent less time and made fewer visits to bait station zones than did control animals. During

and after shocking, wolves shifted 0.7 km away from the bait station zone. Although active shocking did restrict wolf access, which could be

useful in controlling wolf depredations during a limited time period, conditioning was not clearly demonstrated once shocking ceased. The

effect of shock collar design and operation on long-term conditioning and shock-conditioned wolves on pack behavior needs further study. If

long-term conditioning is possible, shock collars could be used by wildlife managers as a nonlethal wolf management method in chronic

problem areas where lethal control has proven ineffective. ( JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT 73(4):518–525; 2009)

KEY WORDS behavior, Canis lupus, gray wolf, lethal control, livestock depredation, nonlethal management, shock collars, site-
aversive conditioning, Wisconsin.

Depredation of livestock by gray wolves (Canis lupus) is
becoming a major issue in the Great Lakes region (Fritts et
al. 1992, Mech 1998). Livestock depredations will increase
as wolves disperse into agricultural landscapes (Kellert 1991,
Mech 1995, Treves et al. 2002). Chronic problem areas
(e.g., farms that suffer livestock losses for �3 consecutive yr)
will expand in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and
northern Wisconsin, USA (Fritts et al. 1992, Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources [WDNR] 1999, Mech
2000). Michigan and Wisconsin residents currently favor
wolf recovery, but support could change if human–wildlife
conflicts continue to increase (Dorrance 1983, Mech 1995).

Lethal control is the primary strategy used to manage wolf
populations (Berryman 1972, Archibald et al. 1991, Mech et
al. 2000). However, lethal methods alone have not
eliminated wolf depredations (Fritts et al. 1992, Mech
1995, Musiani et al. 2005). Depredations often reoccur
within a year after lethal control (Bradley et al. 2005). In the
case of recovering wolf populations (e.g, Mexican gray wolf
[C. lupus baileyi] and the red wolf [C. rufus]), where numbers
are low and each animal is considered valuable, lethal
control may remain a last resort (Parker and Phillips 1991,
Peek et al. 1991).

Nonlethal control methods are publicly more acceptable
than lethal options (Reynolds 1996). However, lethal
control and nonlethal control should not be viewed as
mutually exclusive. If effective, nonlethal control options

could be developed and integrated with current manage-
ment, negative consequences of wolf depredations could be
further mitigated. Although many different forms of
nonlethal control exist, few have been thoroughly tested
on free-ranging wild wolves (Gehring et al. 2006).

Shock collars are one of the least understood methods of
nonlethal control for wolves. They differ from other forms
of nonlethal control in that they could result in behavioral
conditioning if the target animal is able to establish a
connection between a specific behavior and a negative
consequence (e.g., pain). If found to be effective, shock
collars may offer site-specific avoidance by conditioning
wolves to avoid livestock pastures, thereby preventing
depredations. Shock collars are regularly used to train or
condition domestic dogs and the low-impulse corrective
shock is considered humane.

Shivik et al. (2003) tested shock collars on captive wolves
and reported that shock collars were difficult to use on
wolves due to logistical and behavioral variability. Although
this method of control has shown inconclusive results on
captive wolves, Andelt et al (1999) reported conditioning
captive coyotes (C. latrans). Andelt et al. (1999), Cooper et
al. (2005), and Schultz et al. (2005) also reported promising
results on free-ranging wild canids. Prior to this research,
shock collars had not been tested on free-ranging wolves in a
controlled experiment. Our objective was to determine if
current shock collar technology could effectively deter free-
ranging wolf movements from using a desirable site.

STUDY AREA

We conducted our study in a 9,000-km2 section of north-
central Wisconsin. This area included Ashland, Forest, Iron,

Lincoln, Price, Oneida, and Vilas counties and bordered the
western edge of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Most of
the study area was an ecological landscape type classified as
Northern Highlands by the WDNR (WDNR 2000). The
study area was 64% forested and encompassed federal, state,
county, timber company, and private land. Most of the study
area was accessible through secondary, 2-track, or retired
logging roads. A portion of the public and private land was
gated and restricted to foot travel for the general public.
Horse, all-terrain vehicle, truck, bicycle, and foot travel were
all common on the remaining roads and trails. Agriculture,
although not abundant, was present principally as cranberry,
potato, soybean, and livestock production. Beef and dairy
cattle operations occurred at a combined density of 12.8
head/km2 in northern Wisconsin (Treves et al. 2002).

Wydeven et al. (2004) and Wydeven and Wiedenhoeft
(2004) estimated that 40 wolf packs with an average of 3.5
animals per pack occurred within this area (i.e., 140 wolves)
with a mean density of 1.5 wolves per 100 km2. White-
tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) occurred at approxi-
mately 1,800 per 100 km2 within the study area (WDNR
2000). The average home-range size of wolf packs within
the study area was 150 km2 (WDNR 2000; Wydeven et al.
2004).

METHODS

We extensively scouted wolf packs within the study area via
scat and track surveys, which included both driving and
walking forest trails within wolf pack territories and visually
observing tracks and scat. We selected packs for study based
on the following criteria. First, we gave priority to packs
with accessible roads within their territories because of our
need to transport equipment and bait in and out of each site.
Thus, we also preferred packs that readily used roads or
forest trails. Lastly, we tried to select packs with �3 adult
animals, because these packs tended to be more established
and less apt to move or disperse. Once we identified study
packs for each season, we randomly assigned each pack to
treatment or control.

We captured one wolf within each pack and chemically
immobilized it with 10 mg/kg of ketamine hydrochloride
and 2 mg/kg of xylazine hydrochloride via an intramuscular
injection (Kreeger 1996). We captured wolves using either a
modified Newhouse number 14 foot-hold trap (Kuehn et al.
1986) with McBride springs and breakaway pan device, a
Cable Restraining Device (17.78 cm 3 19.70 cm cable with
a stop at 38 cm), or a McBride number 7 foot-hold trap with
Kevlar padded jaws. Once wolves were immobilized, we
monitored them for temperature, respiration, and pulse. We
sexed, weighed, measured, and pit-tagged wolves. We
defined age based on tooth eruption and wear patterns
(Van Ballengerghe and Mech 1975). We collected blood
samples from all wolves for health and genetic analysis
conducted by the WDNR. We fitted all healthy adult
wolves (.1 yr) with a 400-g radiocollar with a 2-hour
mortality sensor (Telonics, Inc., Mesa, AZ). In 2003, we
also placed Televilt Global Positioning System (GPS)

collars on 3 wolves, but all of these collars failed (see
Results). We fitted treatment wolves with an Innotek
Training Shock Collar (Invisible Fence Technologies,
Garrett, IN) in addition to the radiocollar.

During the 2003 field season, we fitted shock collar units
with factory probes onto a separate collar with the probes on
the underside of the neck, which we shaved down to the
skin to ensure probe contact (Fig. 1). In 2004 we fitted
shock units with custom rounded probes and mounted them
on the back of the radiocollar (i.e., back of the neck) via a
custom drop-off design (Fig. 1). This new design had an
extended battery life and was proven to eliminate damage to
or irritation of the necks of animals wearing them (Hawley
2005). Also, we tested all shock collars for shock consistency
before we fitted them on a wolf during the 2004 season. Our
research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee at Central Michigan University (IACUC
no. 01-03).

Adult wolves found to have major health problems (e.g.,
sarcoptic mange) and pups of the year were not included in
our study. We fitted pups with radiocollars only for WDNR
population monitoring. We intravenously administered 0.15
mg/kg of yohimbine hydrochloride to all chemically
immobilized wolves as a reversal agent before releasing
them (Kreeger 1996).

When possible, we selected control wolves from wolves
that had been previously radiocollared by the WDNR to
have experiments running concurrently. If possible we
radiocollared and used as controls captured wolves that we
did not shock-collar and use as treatments. Within treat-
ment packs, we captured a second animal only if the first
proved unusable in the experiment. To avoid variation in
wolf behavior and movement patterns, we conducted all
research during the rendezvous season, when adult wolves
leave pups in a designated area between hunting and
territorial excursions. We conducted experiments �1.6 km
from capture sites to avoid site aversion by recently captured
wolves.

We identified as bait sites forest trail intersections within
each wolf’s territory. We selected bait sites based on historic
WDNR telemetry location data and track and scat surveys.
For each site we defined an inner shock zone (extending 30
m from the center of the intersection) and an outer
detection zone (extending from 30 m to 75 m from the
center of the intersection). We baited the centers of the sites
with one road-killed deer every 2–3 days as needed. We
monitored all bait sites for tracks by brushing soil around the
site before leaving and checking for new tracks upon arrival.
We set up radio data loggers (HABIT Research Ltd.,
Vancouver, BC, Canada) to monitor wolf movements at
each site. We used deep-cycle marine batteries to power data
loggers, which lasted for approximately 2 months. We
mounted data loggers in trees with antennas extending
approximately 3 m above the ground. We used only trees
with thick cover to conceal data loggers from wolves and
humans. Data loggers scanned defined very high frequencies
(VHF) for percent signal strength and recorded the date and

Hawley et al. � Wolf Response to Shock Collars 519



time the animal spent in the area. We calibrated percent
signal strengths representing each zone by testing 10
Telonics radiocollars held at 50 cm above the ground.
When the data logger began picking up a signal (.1%) the
collar was approximately 75 m from the center of the zone
(i.e., start of the detection zone). When the signal strength
reached a mean of 20% (SD ¼ 1.2%), the collar was
approximately 30 m from the center of the zone (i.e., the
start of the shock zone). As such, we considered a wolf
recorded at 1–19% signal strength in the detection zone,
and we considered a wolf recorded at 20–100% signal
strength in the shock zone (Fig. 2). Data loggers allowed us
to monitor all radiocollared wolves for time of visit to the
shock and detection zone, length of visit, and distance from
the center of the zone.

We placed shock towers at the center of each treatment
site in close vicinity to the data logger. We mounted shock
towers in a 65 cm3 100 cm wooden box containing a deep-
cycle marine battery power source and custom shock timer
(Schultz et al. 2005). Timers allowed for the shock unit to
remain on for 13 seconds, then off for 13 seconds,
continuously, which was intended to allow wolves time to
react while not being shocked continuously. We removed
antennas from shock transmitters to maintain a shock zone
with a 30-m radius. Wolves wearing a shock collar would
receive a low-impulse shock every 13 seconds, for 13 seconds
upon entry into the shock zone. The outer detection zone
served as a monitoring zone only; no shock was ever
administered (treatments or controls) to wolves in this outer
zone. Control animals did not receive a shock collar, yet we
still monitored them via data logger in both zones.

As soon as it was established that collared wolves had

visited bait sites at least once (which took 2–4 days), we
began experimentation. Our experimental design included
1) 14-day before-shock period during which we recorded
wolf movements at the site (no shock) for both treatments
and controls; 2) 14-day during-shock period during which

battery life, rounded probes, and drop off designed to release shock unit in 2–3 months time. We shaved skin under the shock unit to ensure probe contact.

the detection zone. We considered recordings between 1% and 20% signal
strength in the detection zone. Recordings between 20% and 100 were in
the shock zone.

we shocked treatment wolves upon entry into the shock
zone; and 3) 14-day after-shock period during which we
recorded wolf movements at the site (no shock) for both
treatments and controls. The amount and extent of
researcher visitations to drop bait and check equipment
was consistent between treatments and controls (every 2–3
days).

All wolves were located via aerial telemetry at least once a
week by the WDNR. We also located all treatment wolves
at least every 2 days via vehicle-mounted ground telemetry.
We only located control wolves via ground telemetry 1–2
times per week or when time allowed. Our vehicle-mounted
telemetry system consisted of a 5-element yagi VHF
antenna mounted 1 m above the roof of a truck. We
mounted a compass rosette and marine electronic compass
in the interior of the vehicle to provide accurate directional
readings (Lovallo et al. 1994). We took �3 bearings on each
animal from established waypoints. We used Locate II to
perform triangulations and to gather estimated animal
locations (Nams 1990). We used the Maximum Likelihood
Estimation (MLE) system within Locate II.

We collected data loggers at each site at the end of the 42-
day monitoring period. We downloaded data to a laptop
computer via a HABIT Research Ltd. program. We used
Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) to sort out
any static recordings such as those caused by lightning,
airplanes, or radiotowers (wolf radiocollar recordings were at
50 pulses/min, whereas static recordings were usually
.1,000 pulses/min). We also scanned a dummy frequency
to ensure that recordings of wolf visitations were legitimate.
We included only recordings on the specific VHF collar
frequency at or near 50 pulses per minute. We sorted all
recordings in Excel by chronological order of each visitation
event.

We used data logger recordings for each treatment and
control wolf to determine daily visitations. We counted a
visitation as an entry into either zone (shock or detection).
The animal had to leave the zone for 2 minutes before
returning and registering a second visitation. We summed
visitation events for each wolf, during each treatment period
(before, during, and after), and in each zone (shock and
detection).

We estimated mean time study wolves spent in the
combined (shock and detection) zone per day, for each of
the 3 time periods (before, during, after) from data logger
readings. Because it was difficult to determine which zone
the wolf was spending time in between data logger
recordings (i.e., readings occurred every 3–12 sec), we
pooled time spent in the shock zone with time spent in the
detection zone. A wolf may simply turn his head, causing
the data logger to pick up a weaker signal, thus causing a
change in the percent signal strength, which may then be
misrepresented as time spent in the wrong zone. We
avoided this problem when recording individual visits to
separate zones, because the wolf had to leave for an extended
period of time and then return before we could consider it a
separate visit. We counted each visit as a discrete moment in

time, which was not possible when trying to estimate the
amount of continuous time the wolf was spending in each
zone. Thus, by pooling the 2 zones together for this dataset,
we minimized this possible source of error.

We combined flight and ground-telemetry locations and
used them as a third dataset. We emphasized treatment
animals when obtaining ground telemetry locations; there-
fore, we did not collect adequate control data for this
dataset. We prioritized locating treatment animals, which
left little or no time for relocating control animals. We
counted animals that we could not locate within 4 km of the
bait site as 4.1 km from the site. We used ArcMap to plot all
wolf locations on digital orthogonal photographs provided
by the WDNR. We then measured distance from the center
of the site for each location and calculated mean distance
from the center of the zone for each time period.

We conducted statistical analyses using SAS statistical
software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). We examined visitation
data using the Shapiro–Wilk test for normality. We log
transformed all data and repeated the Shapiro–Wilk test to
ensure data were normally distributed (a ¼ 0.05).

For visitation and temporal data at bait sites, we used a 2-
factor repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA;
PROC GLM; SAS Institute 1989) to examine between
subject effects (i.e., group effects: control and shock collar),
within subject effects (i.e, time period: before, during, after),
and the interaction of group and time period. We used the
univariate tests for within subject effects because we found
no violation of Type H covariance after performing
sphericity tests (P ¼ 0.318 to 0.994; SAS Institute 1989).
We used a contrast transformation to treat the first time
period (before shocking) as a control level to which we
compared the during- and after-shock time periods. We
used a one-way ANOVA for correlated samples to detect
variation of mean distance from the zone and to measure
how wolf movements changed before, during, and after
shock treatment. We used the Tukey test to decipher where
significant differences occurred, if at all (Zar 1996). To
justify pooling data for the 2003 and 2004 field seasons, we
used a 2-sample t-test to test for differences between data
for the before-, during-, and after-treatment periods.

RESULTS

We captured 17 wolves during the 2003 and 2004 field
seasons and excluded 3 treatment wolves from the sample
due to failure of GPS collars. We collected data for 5
treatment wolves and 5 control wolves from separate packs
(Table 1). Although we used different collar designs for the
2 field seasons, we pooled our results for the seasons after
finding no differences between data for the before-treatment
(P ¼ 0.451), during-treatment (P ¼ 0.206), or after-
treatment (P ¼ 0.347) periods.

We did not find a group effect (i.e., between subjects
effect) for wolf visitation to the detection zone (F1,8 ¼ 0.02,
P¼ 0.905). We detected an interaction between time period
and group (F2,16 ¼ 4.02, P ¼ 0.039). Visitation to the
detection zone during the shocking time period decreased in

Hawley et al. � Wolf Response to Shock Collars 521



shock-collared wolves, but not in control wolves (F1,8 ¼
7.54, P¼ 0.025; Fig. 3a). We did not detect any decrease in
visitation to the detection zone for shock-collared or control
wolves in the after-shocking time period (F1,8 ¼ 0.00, P ¼
0.962; Fig. 3a).

We did not find a group effect for wolf visitation to the
shock zone (F1,8 ¼ 0.12, P ¼ 0.743). However, there was
interaction between time period and group (F2,16¼ 10.65, P
¼ 0.001). Visitation to the shock zone during the shocking
time period by shock-collared wolves decreased whereas
control wolves did not demonstrate this trend (F1,8 ¼ 23.11,
P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 3b). We noted a slight decrease in visitation
to the shock zone for shock-collared, but not control wolves,
by the after shocking time period (F1,8 ¼ 3.90, P ¼ 0.084;
Fig. 3b).

We did not find a group effect for the number of minutes
wolves spent in the combined zone (F1,8 ¼ 0.52, P¼ 0.492).
There was an interaction between time period and group
(F2,16¼ 4.44, P¼0.029). Shocked-collared wolves spent less
time in the combined zone during the shocking time period,
whereas control wolves did not demonstrate this trend (F1,8
¼ 8.73, P ¼ 0.018; Fig. 3c). We noted no decrease in time
spent in the combined zone for shock-collared or control
wolves in the after-shocking time period (F1,8 ¼ 3.00, P ¼
0.122; Fig. 3c). We commonly recorded false presence
indications while data loggers were scanning dummy
frequencies, although none of these were at the correct
VHF pulse rate. All false positive recordings were .1,000
pulses per minute, whereas true presence recordings were
between 48 pulses and 51 pulses per minute. Thus, we easily
screened false positive recordings by pulse rate.

We detected a shift in mean wolf distance from the center
of the site between the before-, during-, and after-treatment
periods for treatment animals. The treatment sample size for
this dataset was 4 instead of 5, because one treatment animal
(Bootjack Lake) did not have sufficient location data to be
included. Before treatment, wolves averaged 1.5 km from
the center of the bait site (approx. 9 locations/period).
During and after treatment, wolves averaged 2.2 km from
the center of the bait site, which equaled a shift of 0.7 km or
32%, going from before-treatment to during- and after-

treatment (Fig. 4). We found a difference in mean distance
from the bait sites in the 3 time periods (F¼7.29, P¼0.02).
A Tukey test detected differences between the before- and
during-treatment and between the before- and after-treat-
ment (HSD0.05 ¼ 855.34, P , 0.05). We detected no
difference between the during- and after-treatment periods
(nonsignificant, P . 0.05).

DISCUSSION

Our results demonstrated that shock collars altered free-
ranging, wild wolf behavior in and around a specific site.
Mean time per day spent in the combined zones by
treatment wolves decreased during treatment, which is
important because if a wolf is not spending time in an area,
then there is less time for a depredation to occur. Our results
also documented a change in where wolves were spending
their time 14 days after treatment. Treatment that occurred
within the shock zone may have indirectly affected behavior
of wolves in the detection zone, where no treatment ever
occurred, which could be important when considering the
idea of a buffer zone around a livestock pasture. By setting
up the pasture as the shock zone, it may be possible to create
an outer buffer zone (i.e., our detection zone) where wolf
activity would decrease as an indirect effect of treatment
occurring within the pasture or shock zone.

There is a possibility that mean time spent in the zone per
day was directly correlated with mean distance from the
zone. Shock-collared wolves shifted 0.7 km further away
from the center of the zone during and after treatment
occurred. If the animal’s mean distance is shifted away from
a pasture, there is a good chance it is going to spend less
time in and around the pasture. Although 0.7 km may not
seem substantial, it could be critical during a sensitive
calving season. During shocking trials, shock-collared
wolves remained in mostly forested, low-road density areas
of their territories. This localization behavior could be
important when considering management situations. Local-
ization behavior may be a display of human avoidance by
wolves, which could be important in excluding wolves from
an area. Similar movement patterns were documented
following a shock of a free-ranging wild wolf in Wisconsin

(Schultz et al. 2005). In 1998, the WDNR captured, shock-
collared, and released a depredating wolf on a livestock
operation. The wolf was monitored via radiotelemetry while
receiving a shock and each time moved farther away from
the farm. These movements demonstrated a large initial
response to the shock and apparent disruption in wolf
movements. The WDNR reported a decrease in depreda-
tions on the farm, but could not determine if any
conditioning occurred (Schultz et al. 2005).

If we extrapolated our results to a management situation,

we would consider a depredating wolf 80% less likely to
even enter a livestock pasture while being treated with a
shock collar for 14 days. If the wolf did enter the pasture
after having received a shock, there would be a strong
chance it would be much more wary than before (Andelt et
al. 1999). So although there is an 80% reduction in visits to
the area, there could be an even higher reduction in attempts
to harass or kill livestock.

Although attack and kill behaviors are separate from
consumption behaviors in wolves, presence of a dead deer
(which we used for bait) in a wolf’s home territory is more
easily accessible than is a domestic cow in a human
settlement (Shivik et al. 2003). In fact, most of our study
packs remained in proximity to the baited sites in the
pretreatment period and would consume each deer within
2–3 days. The length of our before-treatment monitoring
period gave wolves 14 days to become comfortable feeding
within the shock zone.

In a management situation, wolves would not be given this
acclimation period, as the shock would be turned on
immediately. In most cases, livestock pastures will occur
on the edge of a wolf’s territory, or at least a less familiar part
of their territory (Fritts et al. 1992). It is possible that most
free-ranging wild wolves will never feel completely con-
fident around a human settlement. Furthermore wolves will
in most cases have been trapped on or near the pasture in
question before being fitted with the shock collar. This
increased level of fear and awareness of humans could
potentially increase efficacy of shock collars within a
livestock pasture (Fritts et al. 1992). Because we observed
few non-wolf tracks at either treatment or control bait sites
other than the occasional coyote, interaction with other
animals was not a factor in our study.

Prior to our research, no experimental assessment had
been done on the possible use of existing shock collar
technology as a nonlethal management method for free-
ranging wolves. Thus, it is difficult to compare our research
with past research, because only captive or observational
studies of free-ranging wolves have been published. Andelt
et al. (1999) and other studies demonstrated shock collars
effectively deterring attacks on sheep by captive coyotes, yet

research results on captive wolves have been mixed (Andelt
1999; Shivik et al. 2002, 2003). It is unclear why these 2
closely related species in captivity have shown such variation
in their reaction to shock collars. Similar to Shivik et al.
(2003), we found variability in wolf response to shock units
during captive trials (Hawley 2005). We believe that much
of the variability was attributable to technological variation
within the shock collars (e.g., variable pulsing of shocks),
rather than behavioral differences (Hawley 2005). It is
possible that Shivik et al. (2003) incorrectly attributed
variability in performance of shock collars to variability in
animal response.

When shocking ceased, some of our treatment wolves
slowly resumed normal movement behavior and began
moving back to the shock site. Inconsistency in shock
delivery may have played a role in the inability of shock
collars to condition wolves to avoid the shock site long term.
During the first field season with the original collar design,
based on manufacturer specifications, we assumed that
battery life would extend .2 months. However, we
performed extensive field tests and discovered that batteries
began to expire halfway through the treatment period,
approximately 20–22 days. Although this may add more
support to the effectiveness of the collars, because the wolves
were only being shocked for an average of 7 days for the first
field season, it is also a possible source of inconsistency in
delivery of treatment. Shock collar battery life was extended
to 50 days for the new collar design we used during the 2004
season.

The new design also had sources of inconsistency (Hawley
2005). During captive trials, we noted that collars would
frequently shift or even flip completely, before correcting
themselves upon further wolf movement (Hawley 2005).
We believe that if a shock collar with a higher degree of
consistency is developed and tested, results could show a
long-term conditioning effect and a greater reduction in or
complete elimination of both wolf visits and time spent in
an area.

If shock collar battery life could be extended from 50 days
to 100 days, reduction in visitations and time spent in the
zone during treatment could prove highly significant in
protecting livestock during the growing season. Treves et al.
(2002) reported that 83% of all verified wolf depredations in
Minnesota and 61% of all verified wolf depredations in
Wisconsin occurred between the months of May and
September. If wolves were excluded from livestock pastures
during that period, we predict that most wolf depredations
could be avoided (Gehring et al. 1996, 2006). Conditioning
may not be necessary if shock collars could actively exclude
wolves from a pasture for an extended period of time. Any
long-term conditioning would then be considered additional
protection. In chronic problem areas, 1 year of protection
could be considered just as effective as lethal control (Fritts
et al. 1992, Bradley et al. 2005). If there is any aversive
conditioning carrying over to the following year, it could
potentially save agencies the time and money of implement-
ing lethal control measures on an annual basis. However,

within nonlethal wolf management it should be a priority to
develop and test new shock collar designs. With consistent,
long-term correction (�14 days), the animal may learn a
site-specific avoidance behavior.

MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS

Our results suggest that shock collars hold potential value
for use as nonlethal control for free-ranging wild wolves in
certain depredation management situations. However, addi-
tional research should focus on measuring the ability of
shock collars to provide long-term conditioning by admin-
istering treatment for the full extent of the battery life and
on improvement of collar design for shock consistency.
Future research should also attempt to quantify effects
shock-collared wolves may have on other pack members.
We suggest the new shock collar design we used should be
further developed and tested to extend battery life,
consistent shock probe contact with the neck, and audible
shock warnings.
