The comment that “everyone’s complaining aboutthe weather, but no one is doing anything about it”is more
a bromide than a joke, but conservationists have a similar re-
frain: A plaintive cry echoes in ivory towers that too many
species are spiraling into oblivion while too little is being
done to forestall the losses. If we compare the ecological cri-
sis of species loss to a series of fires, it seems that conserva-
tionists tend to race each other, trying to be the first to
discover a new conflagration, rather than develop the tools that
will extinguish the flames. The grants go to build race cars,
when what we need is a squadron of fire engines—or at least
a few buckets of water. We need to do more than document
extinctions; common sense dictates that we prevent them.

The protection of large carnivores presents a particular chal-
lenge because of the conflicts that can arise between human
interests—specifically the protection of livestock—and the
maintenance of populations of predators. Conflict with peo-
ple kills wolves (Canis lupus), lions (Panthera leo), leopards
(Panthera pardus), cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus), and spotted
hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) where agricultural areas border
these predators’ range (Woodroffe and Ginsberg 1998, Ogada
et al. 2003), and conflict-mitigation measures are increasingly
necessary as it becomes apparent that reserves and legal 
status are not sufficient for ensuring predators’ survival. For
rare, large predators, reserves will probably never be big
enough, and transgression beyond their edges will continue
to lead to the death of individuals and sometimes the decline
of species (Woodroffe and Ginsberg 1998, Woodroffe 2001).
Indeed, Woodroffe (2001) noted that “reducing the numbers
of predators shot, speared, poisoned and trapped by people
is the single most pressing need to halt global carnivore 
declines.” Effective management of predator damage is also

a conservation issue, and the edges—that is, the intersections
of carnivores, people, and livestock—are where efforts need
to be focused.

This article provides a brief description of newly developing
tools and concepts for scientists, conservationists, and man-
agers. Classical and common techniques of wildlife damage
management are described elsewhere (Hyngstrom et al. 1994,
Conover 2002), as are surveys of common nonlethal meth-
ods (Linnell et al. 1996, Smith et al. 2000, Shivik 2004).
However, predation management is a discipline of rapidly
growing theory, tools, and technology, necessitating an
overview of recent developments. I hope in this article to stim-
ulate new applied and theoretical approaches and to spur the
advancement of methods that conserve predators by resolv-
ing their conflicts with humans.

Tools and concepts
Broadly, techniques for managing predation can be employed
by government agencies and trained professionals in wildlife
management, or applied by livestock producers and those di-
rectly affected by predation. For example, husbandry practices
such as gathering livestock into protected areas during 
vulnerable times (e.g., shed lambing or night penning) are
tools that owners have used for hundreds of years to protect
livestock (Robel et al. 1981, Wagner 1988, Ogada et al. 2003).

Tools for the Edge: What’s New
for Conserving Carnivores

JOHN A. SHIVIK

The loss of large carnivores at the edges of parks, preserves, and human habitations threatens the conservation of many species. Thus, effective 
predation management is a conservation issue, and tools to mitigate conflicts between humans and predators are required. Both disruptive-stimulus
(e.g., fladry, Electronic Guards, radio-activated guards) and aversive-stimulus (e.g., electronic training collars, less-than-lethal ammunition) approaches
are useful, and technological advances have led to many new, commercially available methods. Evaluating the biological and economic efficiency of
these methods is important. However, social and psychological effects should also be considered. The management of animal damage to human 
property is necessary, and methods that allow the coexistence of livestock and large predators must be employed. With further research and 
development that includes interdisciplinary approaches to management methods, biologists may be better able to conserve large carnivore species by
ameliorating human conflicts with them.

Similarly, predator-proof fences have been installed and stud-
ied for generations (Jardine 1909). In this article I will con-
centrate on novel (or less well-known and used) methods that
are designed to be used by professional wildlife managers, es-
pecially those managing rare or threatened species, to re-
duce or ameliorate the effects of depredation.

In a theoretical framework, there are two basic conceptual
approaches to repelling carnivores (Clark 1997). First are
disruptive-stimulus approaches (primary repellents), which
act by disrupting appetitive behaviors and “frightening”
predators away from resources. Second are aversive-stimulus
approaches (secondary repellents), which modify behavior
through conditioning.

Disruptive stimuli. Disruptive-stimulus approaches are at-
tractive because of their relatively low cost and simplicity, but
it is important to acknowledge that frightening devices are not
a panacea for predatory woes (Bomford and O’Brien 1990).
Predators will rarely form a conditional response to disrup-
tive stimuli; rather, they normally habituate to the stimuli,
which eventually renders the approach ineffective (Shivik
and Martin 2001). However, a series of approaches are emerg-
ing that may be suitable for high-risk, short-duration pre-
dation threats.

Fladry (figure 1) is a tool of ancient derivation for deter-
ring wolves (Fritts 1982, Musiani and Visalberghi 2001) that
has recently become commercially available and available by
the kilometer (Carol’s Creations, Arco, Idaho). Fladry is in-
stalled by hanging lines of flags around fields to prevent in-
trusion; it has some effect of dissuading wolves from entering
areas (Musiani et al. 2003), although other predators are not
susceptible to it. Its effectiveness on less wary species (e.g.,
ursid or avian predators) is limited (Shivik et al. 2003a), but

initial estimates indicate a 60-day period of effectiveness for
wolves. Essentially, anything new or different is likely to elicit
avoidance behavior from predators, but this effect disap-
pears over time. For example, fitting livestock with hard plas-
tic collars (figure 2) may provide some protection (King
2004), but eventually predators tend to return to killing,
albeit in a different manner that avoids the collar (Burns and
Mason 1996).

The Electronic Guard (Linhart et al. 1992) uses a daylight
sensor and a 12-volt battery to activate an intermittent siren
and strobe light at night. When multiple units were used, and
their locations altered, they provided significant protection
(8–103 days) to sheep from coyotes (Linhart et al. 1992).
However, the Electronic Guard is not currently produced
and sold. More recently, however, a programmable light and
sound device known as the ScareCall (figure 3; ML Designs,
Goleta, California) has been developed, and production of it
and other improved devices is likely. Although current ver-
sions of electronic repellents have not been rigorously field
tested, they may be at least as effective as Electronic Guards
for protecting livestock in small areas, and more compact and
effective than other noise- or light-making devices (Fritts
1982).

Methods of delaying habituation, such as behavior-
contingent activation (Shivik and Martin 2001), are impor-
tant for increasing the longevity of effectiveness of disruptive
stimuli, and modern sensors have been incorporated into
some tools. The Model 9000 frightening device (Avian 
Systems, Louisville, Kentucky), commonly known as the 
radio-activated guard (RAG; figure 4), employs a scanning 
radio receiver to monitor the proximity of radio-collared
animals (Breck et al. 2003). If a radio-marked predator ap-
proaches a protected area, such as a calving pasture, the unit
activates a strobe light and a series of sound effects to prevent
the predator from advancing. The RAG is complicated because

it requires radio-tagging predators, a significant effort.
Alternatively, Shivik and colleagues (2003a) used a movement-
activated guard (which uses passive infrared sensors to detect
approaching predators) in a multiple-predator system and de-
termined that the electronic devices were more effective than
passive disruptive stimuli (fladry) or electronic training 
collars (see below). More sophisticated sensor designs using
radar and other technologies may result in sensors that are use-
ful in a wide array of predation management situations.

My lab is continually working with industry and electrical
engineers to develop a variety of disruptive stimulus devices,
but for biologists in the field, it also may be useful to consider
unusual sources for ideas and products. In the United States,
a survey of garden catalogs can uncover interesting devices,
such as motion-activated Critter Gitters (Amtek Pet Products,
San Diego) or motion-activated sprinkler systems (Contech
Electronics Inc., Victoria, Canada) designed to protect vege-
tation from deer. Most electronic frightening devices have
shown limited effectiveness for field use on deer (Odocoileus
spp.) and require improvement in sensor technology to re-
duce occurrences of false alarms (Gilsdorf et al. 2004), but be-
cause large carnivores are usually secretive, the devices may
be very useful for them.

Many aspects of electronic disruptive-stimulus devices re-
quire more thorough research. The optimum area and du-
ration of effective protection are not known, although a
working hypothesis is 10 hectares and 2–3 months per device.
The relative (and potentially synergistic) effects of auditory
and visual stimuli have not been adequately examined, nor
has the effectiveness of incorporating other sensory modal-
ities, such as olfactory stimuli. For simple stimuli, even wary
animals such as wolves will eventually habituate completely
and even approach the devices (Fritts 1982). Methods of de-
creasing habituation, such as behavior-contingent activation

and randomization of stimulus location and presentation, have
been indicated, but electronic devices are relatively new, and
their use is probably far from being optimized.

An old technology of special note due to its recent popu-
larity is the use of guard dogs. Guard dogs were investigated
in the late 1970s and 1980s in the United States (Linhart et
al. 1979, Green et al. 1984) and have been largely incorporated
into western US sheep production operations; indeed, by
1993, 65 percent of the sheep producers in Colorado were us-
ing guard dogs (Andelt 1999, Andelt and Hopper 2000).
Dogs are thought to be effective against wolves in parts of Eu-
rope (Rigg 2001, Fritts et al. 2003). In the United States, how-
ever, complications arise when wolves sometimes befriend, or
more often kill, guard dogs (Bangs et al. 2005). Indeed,
throughout the world, wolves also kill dogs wherever the two
canids occur, even to the point of dogs’ being an important
food supply for some wolves (Fritts et al. 2003). Thus, guard
dogs are a useful tool, but not a panacea. Volumes have been
written about the use of guard dogs worldwide (Rigg 2001),
and in that sense, there is little new in their use. In a theoret-
ical context, however, dogs and other guard animals (Green
1989, Meadows and Knowlton 2000) can be thought of as 
behavior-contingent, multisensory disruptive stimulus 
producers, and continued understanding of their training and
use may result in what amounts to the ultimate disruptive
stimulus device.

Aversive stimuli and behavior modification. Aversive condi-
tioning using electrical stimulation is common in the psy-
chological literature and has also been applied commonly as
a pet training tool (e.g., electronic dog training collars). Lin-
hart and colleagues (1976) and Andelt and colleagues (1999)
used electric shock to teach captive coyotes not to attack spe-
cific prey. However, available technology was ineffective for
conditioning wild wolves against attacking livestock, largely
because of logistical concerns and variability in response to
the negative stimulus (Shivik et al. 2003b). One approach, us-
ing electrified wires paired with novel signals, may promote
an aversion to a barrier; “turbo fladry” that incorporates
electrically charged wires, for example, is currently available
(Carol’s Creations, Arco, Idaho). Establishing conditioned
avoidance to fladry could result in a simple but efficient bar-
rier for many predators. Other devices, such as the electrified
Nuisance Bear Controller (R. E. Arnold, Superior, Wisconsin)
may disrupt bear damage to apiaries and then condition the
bears to avoid these localized resources.

Physical harassment may be used to form an aversion to a
behavior. For aversion, newly developed devices include
paintball-type weapons using rounds filled with capsicum
powder (PepperBall Technologies Incorporated, San Diego).
Shotguns can be used to fire rubber bullets (Milstor Corpo-
ration, Indio, California) or beanbag rounds (Defense Tech-
nology Corporation of America, Jacksonville, Florida).
Projectiles can be coupled with harassing dogs (Beckmann et
al. 2004). However, sales of less-than-lethal ammunition may
be limited to those authorized and trained by law enforcement
personnel. Furthermore, their use may pose some risk both
to the predator being shot and to the person who employs the
projectiles. Capsaicin pepper rounds, for example, may require
being within 20–30 meters (m) of a predator, and rubber bul-
lets have limited accuracy at 60–100 m. Many predators are
likely to develop a conditioned aversion to the person or ve-
hicle applying the conditioning stimuli, rather than general-
izing to an area or behavior. Furthermore, the duration of these
methods’ effectiveness is likely to be limited to less than 1
month for black bears (Beckmann et al. 2004).

Because a high degree of vigilance is necessary to effectively
repel predators from a site, a radio warning system (i.e., re-
mote alarm) for nuisance bears has been developed in
Yosemite National Park; when a bear is detected at a camp-
ground, an automated system warns park rangers. The sys-
tem has quadrupled the sightings of problem bears in
campgrounds, and reduced the number of bear visits per
night by one-third (Breck et al. 2005).

Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is a powerful training
technique that was initially heralded as a broadly applicable
solution to the problem of animal damage, but was then
mired in controversy and equivocal results and is now not used
even where it is legal (Conover and Kessler 1994). CTA may,
however, be useful in many situations and should continue
to be examined, especially for limiting consumptive behav-
iors (e.g., bear damage to apiaries or crops), if not predation

behaviors (i.e., hunting and killing) (Ternent and Garshelis
1999).

The use of contraception for predation management has
recently been investigated, because predators that need to
feed their offspring require more food than those that do not
have young, and thus predators that have been sterilized are
not as likely to damage livestock as are reproductive preda-
tors (Till and Knowlton 1983). Bromley and Gese (2001)
showed that sheep predation was reduced and predator ter-
ritories were maintained when coyotes were sterilized. The
technique may be counterproductive as a conservation tool
if reproductive output is essential, but there is room for more
investigation, because sterilization may help to stabilize lo-
calized populations of predators and have longer-lasting ef-
fectiveness than lethal methods, at least for territorial predators.
Appropriate chemical contraceptives and delivery systems
have not yet been developed, however, and additional re-
search is required.

Evaluating effectiveness and choosing a tool. There are three
primary means to gauge the effectiveness and use of man-
agement tools: biological efficiency, economic efficiency, and
psychological assuagement. Table 1 provides an overview of
the biological and economical efficiency of various methods.
Relative to conservation goals, identifying the most useful
management technique is a process of optimizing the degree
of intensive management relative to the biological importance
of individual predators in the population (Shivik 2004). Eco-
nomically, the effectiveness of a tool tends to be directly re-
lated to its cost and complexity; therefore, choosing a tool to
use is also an optimization process, balancing cost and com-
plexity against maximum sustainable effectiveness. Further-
more, because each method works for only a limited time, each
method should be used only during the period of greatest po-
tential for predator–human conflict. A RAG box, for instance,
should be used only during the few months when calves are
smallest and most vulnerable; the box should otherwise be re-
moved from the field. It will lose all effectiveness if deployed
throughout the year. Lastly, no one device is sufficient: Long-
term conflicts will best be managed with a variety of tools.

In general, nonlethal methods are usually considered ex-
pensive (e.g., a RAG may cost $2000–$3000, in contrast with
the < $1 price of a bullet), but ancillary costs, longevity of ef-
fectiveness, and goals of conservation using each method
should also be considered. Enjoying the coexistence of preda-
tors and livestock is a luxury that may be unaffordable in some
countries (Fritts et al. 2003), but the usefulness of newly de-
veloped techniques may not be most appropriately evaluated
by their ratio of cost to damage prevented; the expense is sub-
sumed within the incalculable cost of the social decision to
support predator populations.

It is important to note that the success of a livestock pro-
tection strategy is not wholly dependent on its biological or
economic efficiency. From a biological perspective, the solu-
tion is simple: If humans prefer one species over another, they
could choose to manage wholly for the preferred species

(e.g., livestock) and continue campaigns to remove all wolves
(Coleman 2004). The human–carnivore relationship is a
complex one, however (Kruuk 2002), with a variety of values
and perspectives impinging. Therefore, when evaluating new
devices and methods, the socioeconomic milieu of predator
management should also be considered. That is, the success
of a management technique often needs to be measured by
the tolerance of humans for a predator, which is a social and
psychological construct—not a predator ecology issue—that
is directly related to the ultimate conservation of a species. For
example, using $1 million per year (Ed Bangs, US Fish and
Wildlife Service, Helena, Montana, personal communica-
tion, 13 April 2005) to protect domestic livestock from wolves
in the Rocky Mountain West appears extreme given the low
level of actual damage, an estimated loss of 128 cows in 2004
(Boyd 2005). However, if herculean efforts to protect livestock
were not made, local social carrying capacity could be lower,
and wolf recovery in the lower 48 United States could be
jeopardized.

The subject of lethal control is also interesting and im-
portant both biologically and psychologically. Lethal removal
may be an important long-term practice for selecting against
depredation behaviors in predator populations (Woodroffe
and Frank 2005) and is ultimately useful for conserving
predators. Relative to human attitudes and actions, in nu-
merous conversations with wolf managers I have been told that
an element required for successful reintroduction of wolves
in the western United States is having the ability to “bring wolf
populations into recovery by shooting them.” In fact, one of
the most important tools for ensuring the successful re-
introduction of some predators may be the ability to lethally 
remove them; excessive concern for an individual predator or
distaste for a particular management technique could be 
indulged at the cost of a species. In terms of conservation in
areas where predators and people interact, the required goal
is not to convince the antipathetic to like carnivores, but to
protect and assuage people enough that they trust biologists
and managers and refrain from killing the predators them-
selves.

It is important for biologists to build a trusting relation-
ship with local human populations in order to manage car-
nivores and conflicts effectively. For example, the persecution
of carnivores depends more on the traditional view of a
species than on the actual damage the species causes (Frank
and Woodroffe 2001), and for a management program to be
successful (both for humans and for wildlife), it will need to
operate accordingly. The methods described in this article can
provide both biological and psychological benefit.

Future needs
Many of the techniques and concepts described in this arti-
cle have been subjected to minimal testing, and much more
applied research is required. Of greater concern is the potential
for methods to be misapplied and the resulting failures gen-
eralized, with subsequent loss of useful methods due to mis-
understanding rather than reliable knowledge. Therefore,
new tools should be applied in an adaptive management sys-
tem during the limited periods of use indicated (table 1), and
with a focus on understanding why they worked or failed to
be effective.

Clever application of biological theory in concert with in-
novative, inexpensive technology could go a long way to-
ward promoting human–carnivore coexistence. It is true that
high-tech approaches such as some of those described in
this article may be affordable only to affluent stakeholders, at
least until more ingenious and inexpensive designs are in-
vented (Sillero-Zubiri et al. 2004), but human coexistence with
predators may be a luxury worth the effort.

Future solutions need to emerge from a mix of biology, so-
ciology, and technology. Attracting students from fields out-
side the biological sciences, such as sociology and engineering,
may be a useful approach. The study of human dimensions
of wildlife management also appears to be growing in strength,
and carnivore biologists should add understanding of
human–ecosystem relationships to their arsenal of tools.
While technological advances may well lead to further im-
provement in predator management, ultimately some of the
tools that are most desperately needed are social ones.
